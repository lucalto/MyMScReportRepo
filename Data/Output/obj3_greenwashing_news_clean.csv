largely result also guiding better ebitda solution what s delta much additional epdr dropping through that s first question gt gt delta working capital ocado retail growing business working capital requirement growing key delta math actually highlighted two key driver that s key difference gt gt perfect maybe second question good visibility new cfc s ramping term additional disclosure example lot client basically saying online sale client really doing many current cfc profitable think would really help hugely really extrapolate draw line guess wider discussion maybe word this gt gt challenge here appreciate smart every time tried work disclose around total site utilization stuff see way apply read client number client clear number disclose disclose think get bigger number site live client might actually able transparent without trying back out well what s kroger s share what s one share what s one share know obviously everybody would love see disclosure around client facility profitability profitability u discus disclose obviously disclose margin generate site disclose cost u serving average site said absolutely u sit start discussing whether think one client s warehouse profitable not even even disclosure see cost line thing like that always see full operating margin estimate certain data data asked disclose gt gt thought maybe aggregate asking specific number done gt gt challenging aggregate moment given relative size ocado retail disclose kroger question easy deduce try end position disclosing something someone else s data gt gt fair enough lastly maybe krogers obviously we ve seen statement highlighting starlett phoenix going come gt gt i m highlighting gt gt basically two cfc specifically krogers coming redraw line basically indication delay kroger cfc today gt gt we ve previously spoken about we re talking cfc etc hope talking future right we re seeing strong growth rodney spoke about think said near doubling last quarter versus quarter last year think that s important number highlight fastest growing part see data business obviously near doubling come demand module existing site long think site despite fact offer extra capacity them still nevertheless become full think watch space let s see happens next gt gt point clarity a well think said phoenix charlotte they re gt gt even better gt gt sorry yeah gt gt hi sarah robert barclays thank taking question firstly mentioned good visibility module rollout fy module end year additional would helpful perspective get indication give confidence visibility midterm given we re seeing side obviously kroger sobeys slowing rollout suppose question is give confidence additional module going get pushed beyond fy timeline gt gt think look number we re putting out effect somewhat conservative term see what s coming committed module live site unsigned deal going live addition behind incremental module site already live see growth already rolling incremental module site already achieved utilization module they re already paying for obviously see site site say okay well one going need already ha going hit three month going hit six month nine month month add up expect need see large reaction forthcoming enhancement we re bringing platform in example we re suddenly saying well shortly time order going give u huge win that s what s going get u number think we ve got upside doe think we ve got strong confidence based rollout site know going live plus module see getting drawn get number gt gt hear you that s helpful thank you quickly oia appreciate early day sale pitch participating moment initial feedback client pitching technology compare peer auto store would helpful incremental color gt gt feedback generally positive guess obviously we re winning every bid enter expect case guess made point earlier fact play particularly strongly larger project we re going smaller project we re strong yet future an auto store particular lot project really small right bottom end market moment there would say we re quite competitive we d like be come bit volume general way guess put color positive feedback people really love solution widely deployed already easily demonstratable huge scale like really enormous throughput scale ocado think mentioned talking speak tremendous confidence solution capable operate take somewhere exactly say tin offer expertise make sure get result people responding positively deep wide knowledge operate automation scale gt gt extremely rare automation project find people achieve written tin signed contract we ve explained morning we re taking potential module live site beyond original design criterion able demonstrate show really unusual gt gt thank you gt gt hi inaudible oaa again picking last comment comment pricing term competitiveness smaller warehouse maybe is could give little bit color that sale effort oaa always going direct effort see partnering solution make sense warehouse whilst mic might well chuck in chance could give u utilization rate range cfc live gt gt last one recently gone live they re extremely low right needing draw module they re drawn capacity wide range think they ve public saying they re drawn now think original seven one kroger site give idea drawing quarter module continue draw down that s high end uk site utilization obviously high varies low they re growing gt gt oaa point i ll reverse order well second question whether always sell direct answer that think no intention always develop integrated reseller channel would say impression made trade show generated lot demand that weekly conversation wide basket integrator resellers ever since exhibited first trade show february late stage project bid we re currently involved project integrator brought u asked could deploy automation project expect going forward healthy mixture both i d like still direct project ocado capability bring something special bear especially project become large definitely nurture think quite big integrated channel long run would expect project done integrator ocado direct sure probably quite large margin point pricing yes like fact we re competitive large scale small scale pricing issue largely borne fact grew grocery volume very high element ocado solution optimized high throughput small deal like auto store many throughput le concern like certainly kind throughput able generate grocery ocado already working lower cost version one two peripheral suitable end market compared very high volume throughput like grocery world came from gt gt quick question me kroger reported sale using delivery system grew nearly overall growth suggesting two channel pursue store fulfillment using company sledge instacart barely growing case able grow much faster two channel sustainable it gt gt guess alice talk part growth talk rest company s growth ronnie pointed out shopper love service np score strong fulfillment rate higher achieve store think there s still long way go kroger fulfillment rate they re best class yet alongside client element endtoend solution use software that s bearing that come we ll see improvement come overall u grew different way know term market crowd sourced independent people bringing grocery car walk supermarket collect them number substitution missing item customer u used compared service delivering quality arriving white glove service chilled van arriving outside house dedicated employee client kroger delivering uniform different experience many u consumer think feedback strong they re seeing strong growth number site strong growth gt gt believe doable term growth rate gt gt look yes definitely going grow strongly know exactly strongly mean we re expecting enhance tam addressed short lead time order think impact strongest felt u market elsewhere u market grew heavy labor model instacart disadvantage every major factor term range pricing freshness accuracy one selling point immediacy shortly time order coming model address immediacy whilst time maintaining chillchain maintaining choice maintaining accuracy much cost effective operate believe partner offer materially lower price team feeding back u done pricing comparison ordering kroger delivery versus ordering kroger s site getting instacart delivery ordering kroger instacart there s material cost difference u think least price sensitive market know think someone came service uk price premium see instacart u would get traction all outside minor immediacy business mean u consumer ultimately notice price quality difference think continue grow gt gt spoke closure southern florida opening spoke matter distance closer customer therefore better economics that s entire explanation gt gt yeah think kroger opened three site they ve said benefit hindsight maybe opened them far away processing site based strong growth see else they re trading need open geography fill site near future therefore serve longer distance got longer cut time significantly higher cost term trunking distance sell closer sell closer gain benefit increased density geography well got ability sell it smart move learn experience needing close them rodney saying going open another one florida obviously leverage site grovelands location that s materially closer cfc original spoke site gt gt last question mark term size there s confusion size contract attempting sign akata technology orca intelligent automation range contract pursuing range pound sign dollar sign contract pursuing check main business gt gt i d say give you think real range probably smallest

lowering vouchering year year improving nursery journey move volume course critical one want grow volume see coming covid suffering year year negative volume still suffering third quarter see volume growth steadily improving second quarter we re very pleased trend would obviously like continue obviously behind scene volume ocado retail powered cfc mentioned before utilization driven growth utilization currently paid live module rsp shed dordon around mentioned earlier we ll able deliver module without ocado retail spend capex new building existing warehouse give growth beyond implied there we ve also seen improving trend cfc efficiency pleased say exceeded uph luton facility eches facility picked new ongrid robotics roll across client network come also talked last mile metric last

incrementally higher conversion rate we re excited that said expect ebitda margin continue build create clear structural advantage channel shift resumed continues growing key conclusion outlook strong first half clear trajectory improving ebitda improving cash flow importantly well placed continue financial operational strategic progress still plenty do track meet mid term capex cost target turn cash flow positive absolute focus helping partner become leading online grocery retailer best serve shopper leverage structural growth opportunity resumption channel shift we ll shift question go ahead marcus gt gt sorry wait mic gt gt that s coming gt gt hi marcus inaudible jp morgan three question maybe first one stephen number we re seeing guiding million le capex guiding million cash flow largely result also guiding better ebitda solution what s delta much additional epdr dropping through that s first question gt gt delta working capital ocado retail growing business working capital requirement growing key delta math actually highlighted two key driver that s key difference gt gt perfect maybe second question good visibility new cfc s ramping term additional disclosure example lot client basically saying online sale client really doing many current cfc profitable think would really help hugely really extrapolate draw line guess wider discussion maybe word this gt gt challenge here appreciate smart every time tried work disclose around total site utilization stuff see way apply read client number client clear number disclose disclose think get bigger number site live client might actually able transparent without trying back out well what s kroger s share what s one share what s one share know obviously everybody would love see disclosure around client facility profitability profitability u discus disclose obviously disclose margin generate site disclose cost u serving average site said absolutely u sit start discussing whether think one client s warehouse profitable not even even disclosure see cost line thing like that always see full operating margin estimate certain data data asked disclose gt gt thought maybe aggregate asking specific number done gt gt challenging aggregate moment given relative size ocado retail disclose kroger question easy deduce try end position disclosing something someone else s data gt gt fair enough lastly maybe krogers obviously we ve seen statement highlighting starlett phoenix going come gt gt i m highlighting gt gt basically two cfc specifically krogers coming redraw line basically indication delay kroger cfc today gt gt we ve previously spoken about we re talking cfc etc hope talking future right we re seeing strong growth rodney spoke about think said near doubling last quarter versus quarter last year think that s important number highlight fastest growing part see data business obviously near doubling come demand module existing site long think site despite fact offer extra capacity them still nevertheless become full think watch space let s see happens next gt gt point clarity a well think said phoenix charlotte they re gt gt even better gt gt sorry yeah gt gt hi sarah robert barclays thank taking question firstly mentioned good visibility module rollout fy module end year additional would helpful perspective get indication give confidence visibility midterm given we re seeing side obviously kroger sobeys slowing rollout suppose question is give confidence additional module going get pushed beyond fy timeline gt gt think look number we re putting out effect somewhat conservative term see what s coming committed module live site unsigned deal going live addition behind incremental module site already live see growth already rolling incremental module site already achieved utilization module they re already paying for obviously see site site say okay well one going need already ha going hit three month going hit six month nine month month add up expect need see large reaction forthcoming enhancement we re bringing platform in example we re suddenly saying well shortly time order going give u huge win that s what s going get u number think we ve got upside doe think we ve got strong confidence based rollout site know going live plus module see getting drawn get number gt gt hear you that s helpful thank you quickly oia appreciate early day sale pitch participating moment initial feedback client pitching technology compare peer auto store would helpful incremental color gt gt feedback generally positive guess obviously we re winning every bid enter expect case guess made point earlier fact play particularly strongly larger project we re going smaller project we re strong yet future an auto store particular lot project really small right bottom end market moment there would say we re quite competitive we d like be come bit volume general way guess put color positive feedback people really love solution widely deployed already easily demonstratable huge scale like really enormous throughput scale ocado think mentioned talking speak tremendous confidence solution capable operate take somewhere exactly say tin offer expertise make sure get result people responding positively deep wide knowledge operate automation scale gt gt extremely rare automation project find people achieve written tin signed contract we ve explained morning we re taking potential module live site beyond original design criterion able demonstrate show really unusual gt gt thank you gt gt hi inaudible oaa again picking last comment comment pricing term competitiveness smaller warehouse maybe is could give little bit color that sale effort oaa always going direct effort see partnering solution make sense warehouse whilst mic might well chuck in chance could give u utilization rate range cfc live gt gt last one recently gone live they re extremely low right needing draw module they re drawn capacity wide range think they ve public saying they re drawn now think original seven one kroger site give idea drawing quarter module continue draw down that s high end uk site utilization obviously high varies low they re growing gt gt oaa point i ll reverse order well second question whether always sell direct answer that think no intention always develop integrated reseller channel would say impression made trade show generated lot demand that weekly conversation wide basket integrator resellers ever since exhibited first trade show february late stage project bid we re currently involved project integrator brought u asked could deploy automation project expect going forward healthy mixture both i d like still direct project ocado capability bring something special bear especially project become large definitely nurture think quite big integrated channel long run would expect project done integrator ocado direct sure probably quite large margin point pricing yes like fact we re competitive large scale small scale pricing issue largely borne fact grew grocery volume very high element ocado solution optimized high throughput small deal like auto store many throughput le concern like certainly kind throughput able generate grocery ocado already working lower cost version one two peripheral suitable end market compared very high volume throughput like grocery world came from gt gt quick question me kroger reported sale using delivery system grew nearly overall growth suggesting two channel pursue store fulfillment using company sledge instacart barely growing case able grow much faster two channel sustainable it gt gt guess alice talk part growth talk rest company s growth ronnie pointed out shopper love service np score strong fulfillment rate higher achieve store think there s still long way go kroger fulfillment rate they re best class yet alongside client element endtoend solution use software that s bearing that come we ll see improvement come overall u grew different way know term market crowd sourced independent people bringing grocery car walk supermarket collect them number substitution missing item customer u used compared service delivering quality arriving white glove service chilled van arriving outside house dedicated employee client kroger delivering uniform different experience many u consumer think feedback strong they re seeing strong growth number site strong growth gt gt believe doable term growth rate gt gt look yes definitely going grow strongly know exactly strongly mean we re expecting enhance tam addressed short lead time order think impact strongest felt u market elsewhere u market grew heavy labor model instacart disadvantage every major factor term range pricing freshness accuracy one selling point immediacy shortly time order coming model address immediacy whilst time maintaining chillchain maintaining choice maintaining accuracy much cost effective operate believe partner offer materially lower price team feeding back u done pricing comparison ordering kroger delivery versus ordering kroger s site getting instacart delivery ordering kroger instacart there s material cost difference u think least price sensitive market know think someone came service uk price premium see instacart u would get traction all outside minor immediacy business mean u consumer ultimately notice price quality difference think continue grow gt gt spoke closure southern florida opening spoke matter distance closer customer therefore better economics that s entire explanation gt gt yeah think kroger opened three site they ve said benefit hindsight maybe opened them far away processing site based strong growth see else they re trading need open geography fill site near future therefore serve longer distance got longer cut time significantly higher cost term trunking distance sell closer sell closer gain benefit increased density geography well got ability sell it smart move learn experience needing close them rodney saying going open another one florida obviously leverage site grovelands location that s materially closer cfc original spoke site gt gt last question mark term size there s confusion size contract attempting sign akata technology orca intelligent automation range contract pursuing range pound sign dollar sign contract pursuing check main business gt gt i d say give you think real range probably smallest project we ve taken seriously far around million largest probably topping little pretty wide range actually that s quite whole range asrs deal market smaller bigger said cover them gt gt thank you gt gt luke holbrook morgan stanley first question refinancing interested hear left late refinance first december million bond gt gt think we ve left late think view we ve got pretty good existing debt structure pretty low cost capital let one run think look market today well are we ve got strong equity story market believe much open generally u confident executing go current that s logic gt gt understood second question eon signed third cfc deal interested hear term deal fee structure first two different fee structure gt gt same gt gt same gt gt final question would nongrocery side guided deal potentially per annum interested hear whether still applies year given pipeline suggesting gt gt that s definitely still possibility year obviously deep insight whether business we re pitching win year ca nt tell many deal might win that s definitely possibility gt gt understood thank you gt gt william wood bernstein first one phoenix charlotte actually go ahead kroger open need wait kroger say go gt gt ultimately day site open client say going live going live ca nt make call strong belief site going live gt gt understood obvious said online grocery penetration increasing look

remainder year gt gt module closed well gt gt there s one module exclusivity canada able return one world situation we ve net switch over drawing down mentioned already monroe module expect see continued growth site well expect growth second half expect material growth compared said last time present open one that s end game turn on prospective client got quite large business could take site put immediately bit like luton that s obviously ideal scenario people building new business obviously they ve got start build up ideally we d like build linear fashion actually realistic they ll build exponential fashion way business grow percentage always talk percentage last year look forward site see number starting want draw down gt gt excellent going back cash flow seminar think talking getting module mid term look like slide showing module fy potentially exponential improvement etc kept guidance tech support overhead flat versus seminar said free cash there s clear roadmap fy missing piece feel like logically consistent gt gt put lot range around free call like midpoint showed model well lot depends well mhe capex assume year well visibility around capex visibility around go life two key difference would say presented cash flow seminar basic economics remain dynamic talked then gt gt i m going add though remain probably slightly improved revenue side improved reimagined technology we re successful bringing engineering cloud cost margin existing live module would forecast stronger forecasting that right number module would forecasting probably le still expect get there taking bit longer what s happened market margin make product better result work we ve done investing product strong result gt gt excellent thank you gt gt one thanks charles thorne jeffries three question too first one tim bit mid level high level question obviously calling two headwind partner behavior existing potential partner food inflation obviously extracting best performance kit would say bigger influence partner behavior recent past reverse evolve move forward recognizing obviously one s really control one something influence building second question bit specific might segue we ve seen eon come third cfc little month maybe month since green bean went live anything early stage green bean economics efficiency performance accelerated third cfc decision hopper very long time lastly one stephen well maybe tim too improving retail performance how s influencing negotiation negotiating leverage mn gt gt i m going go reverse order might ask remind asked me we re commenting beyond fact we ve got ongoing conversation think said today constructive conversation got great working relationship day strategy meeting orl recently relationship mn strong think archie put nicely joint venture sometimes difficult moment difficult moment we re working together mature way conversation confidential ongoing term question i m remembering first question about think influence growth around market sectoral trend around u working closely partner they re improving operation stuff think bit both think online market growing went couple year decline even absolute volume suggest move towards automation probably hold back making decision whilst see stabilizes going continue growing think one interesting number basket size starting actually slightly stronger orl before basket size falling actually bigger driver loss volume orl saw strong trajectory inaudible growth there think stable economic environment stable pricing wage input price like energy stuff like that easier business make investment decision underlying growth sector term online channel shift that s positive what s definitely also influence true simple phenomenal brick mortar retailer buying great software robot ocado putting together that s like bringing ingredient bringing oven expecting fantastic product end also need chef middle think we re working together partner help leverage brilliant thing bring leverage bring party well together get that deliver outstanding offer shopper so grow efficiently grow economically sustainable ultimately profitable way that s we re believe deliver strong result future middle part question gt gt evidence green bean gt gt look again talk individual client s economics evidence growth obviously decided commit warehouse large warehouse tokyo big metropolitan area extremely big metropolitan area they ve got big ambition obviously they re happy progress they ve made date make decision gt gt thanks charles allen bloomberg intelligence three technical question first much improvement technology profit could attributed basically empty module one charging million presumably little cost anymore secondly cash flow forecast assuming retail ebita contribution cash flow forecast even deconsolidated then gt gt could take one time that s okay first one hatfield fee million year cost structure dissimilar warehouse there s million would operating cost live imagine there s still bit going we ve got unwind we ve got dismantle facility etc i m sure exactly much transfer in there s element there huge amount it next question wa gt gt next question forecast positive cash flow include retail ebitda contribution gt gt yes doe gt gt pretty modest number give precise number know ocado retail cash generative today generates pretty modest ebitda insufficient cover lease cost capital recharges ocado group doe short answer question modest amount gt gt thirdly considering asset backed financing solution refinance debt next month i gt gt think definitely something horizon future site interest u historical option historical definitely something people talking u future site existing potentially new client get mic way side we ve got another one side like that gt gt thank you inaudible coley ubs really couple question please i ll go one one think first one talked structural impediment reaching profitability client guess maybe could talk couple key issue partnership success trying solve get there particular side client really getting close targeted economics obviously need go detail helpful gt gt powered upon success highlighting certain decision could fall either side showed one earlier range people intuitively think well i ll put range that s average supermarket area opposed to i ll put differentiated larger range put every product that s available supermarket area i ll go find thing wider appeal whether that s specific ethnic product wider range organic premium product whatever might be ocado retail done well year able show people data show impact like that may nothing partner success trying persuade retailer supply chain retail team go that thing drive basket size improve acquisition improve retention improve frequency improve medium medium another area number client existing business create medium opportunity ocado retail s medium tape year â million percentage sale probably global average profitability partner yet gone money helping understand that s for use tool sell tool go talk to around supply chain minimize waste whilst time keeping extremely high level availability around

per eighthour route van improving labor utilization improving supply chain availability improving waste improving acquisition retention literally across board work together critical work together partner see material improvement helping drive behavior outcome want see partner want see gt gt thank you second one term technology solution midterm ebitda margin could talk much improvement going driven contribution versus direct operating cost time thank you gt gt they re going evolve mean margin hiding decent ebitda margin technology solution think operational leverage strong will course depend number live module go live module contribution around â million per module take technology cost probably â million pnl number similarly support cost well around see operational leverage business mid high single ten percent ebitda margin gt gt look think seen think number put today percent term marginal contribution expect reimagine revenue increase despite incremental automation roll

cash flow positive absolute focus helping partner become leading online grocery retailer best serve shopper leverage structural growth opportunity resumption channel shift we ll shift question go ahead marcus gt gt sorry wait mic gt gt that s coming gt gt hi marcus inaudible jp morgan three question maybe first one stephen number we re seeing guiding million le capex guiding million cash flow largely result also guiding better ebitda solution what s delta much additional epdr dropping through that s first question gt gt delta working capital ocado retail growing business working capital requirement growing key delta math actually highlighted two key driver that s key difference gt gt perfect maybe second question good visibility new cfc s ramping term additional disclosure example lot client basically saying online sale client really doing many current cfc profitable think would really help hugely really extrapolate draw line guess wider discussion maybe word this gt gt challenge here appreciate smart every time tried work disclose around total site utilization stuff see way apply read client number client clear number disclose disclose think get bigger number site live client might actually able transparent without trying back out well what s kroger s share what s one share what s one share know obviously everybody would love see disclosure around client facility profitability profitability u discus disclose obviously disclose margin generate site disclose cost u serving average site said absolutely u sit start discussing whether think one client s warehouse profitable not even even disclosure see cost line thing like that always see full operating margin estimate certain data data asked disclose gt gt thought maybe aggregate asking specific number done gt gt challenging aggregate moment given relative size ocado retail disclose kroger question easy deduce try end position disclosing something someone else s data gt gt fair enough lastly maybe krogers obviously we ve seen statement highlighting starlett phoenix going come gt gt i m highlighting gt gt basically two cfc specifically krogers coming redraw line basically indication delay kroger cfc today gt gt we ve previously spoken about we re talking cfc etc hope talking future right we re seeing strong growth rodney spoke about think said near doubling last quarter versus quarter last year think that s important number highlight fastest growing part see data business obviously near doubling come demand module existing site long think site despite fact offer extra capacity them still nevertheless become full think watch space let s see happens next gt gt point clarity a well think said phoenix charlotte they re gt gt even better gt gt sorry yeah gt gt hi sarah robert barclays thank taking question firstly mentioned good visibility module rollout fy module end year additional would helpful perspective get indication give confidence visibility midterm given we re seeing side obviously kroger sobeys slowing rollout suppose question is give confidence additional module going get pushed beyond fy timeline gt gt think look number we re putting out effect somewhat conservative term see what s coming committed module live site unsigned deal going live addition behind incremental module site already live see growth already rolling incremental module site already achieved utilization module they re already paying for obviously see site site say okay well one going need already ha going hit three month going hit six month nine month month add up expect need see large reaction forthcoming enhancement we re bringing platform in example we re suddenly saying well shortly time order going give u huge win that s what s going get u number think we ve got upside doe think we ve got strong confidence based rollout site know going live plus module see getting drawn get number gt gt hear you that s helpful thank you quickly oia appreciate early day sale pitch participating moment initial feedback client pitching technology compare peer auto store would helpful incremental color gt gt feedback generally positive guess obviously we re winning every bid enter expect case guess made point earlier fact play particularly strongly larger project we re going smaller project we re strong yet future an auto store particular lot project really small right bottom end market moment there would say we re quite competitive we d like be come bit volume general way guess put color positive feedback people really love solution widely deployed already easily demonstratable huge scale like really enormous throughput scale ocado think mentioned talking speak tremendous confidence solution capable operate take somewhere exactly say tin offer expertise make sure get result people responding positively deep wide knowledge operate automation scale gt gt extremely rare automation project find people achieve written tin signed contract we ve explained morning we re taking potential module live site beyond original design criterion able demonstrate show really unusual gt gt thank you gt gt hi inaudible oaa again picking last comment comment pricing term competitiveness smaller warehouse maybe is could give little bit color that sale effort oaa always going direct effort see partnering solution make sense warehouse whilst mic might well chuck in chance could give u utilization rate range cfc live gt gt last one recently gone live they re extremely low right needing draw module they re drawn capacity wide range think they ve public saying they re drawn now think original seven one kroger site give idea drawing quarter module continue draw down that s high end uk site utilization obviously high varies low they re growing gt gt oaa point i ll reverse order well second question whether always sell direct answer that think no intention always develop integrated reseller channel would say impression made trade show generated lot demand that weekly conversation wide basket integrator resellers ever since exhibited first trade show february late stage project bid we re currently involved project integrator brought u asked could deploy automation project expect going forward healthy mixture both i d like still direct project ocado capability bring something special bear especially project become large definitely nurture think quite big integrated channel long run would expect project done integrator ocado direct sure probably quite large margin point pricing yes like fact we re competitive large scale small scale pricing issue largely borne fact grew grocery volume very high element ocado solution optimized high throughput small deal like auto store many throughput le concern like certainly kind throughput able generate grocery ocado already working lower cost version one two peripheral suitable end market compared very high volume throughput like grocery world came from gt gt quick question me kroger reported sale using delivery system grew nearly overall growth suggesting two channel pursue store fulfillment using company sledge instacart barely growing case able grow much faster two channel sustainable it gt gt guess alice talk part growth talk rest company s growth ronnie pointed out shopper love service np score strong fulfillment rate higher achieve store think there s still long way go kroger fulfillment rate they re best class yet alongside client element endtoend solution use software that s bearing that come we ll see improvement come overall u grew different way know term market crowd sourced independent people bringing grocery car walk supermarket collect them number substitution missing item customer u used compared service delivering quality arriving white glove service chilled van arriving outside house dedicated employee client kroger delivering uniform different experience many u consumer think feedback strong they re seeing strong growth number site strong growth gt gt believe doable term growth rate gt gt look yes definitely going grow strongly know exactly strongly mean we re expecting enhance tam addressed short lead time order think impact strongest felt u market elsewhere u market grew heavy labor model instacart disadvantage every major factor term range pricing freshness accuracy one selling point immediacy shortly time order coming model address immediacy whilst time maintaining chillchain maintaining choice maintaining accuracy much cost effective operate believe partner offer materially lower price team feeding back u done pricing comparison ordering kroger delivery versus ordering kroger s site getting instacart delivery ordering kroger instacart there s material cost difference u think least price sensitive market know think someone came service uk price premium see instacart u would get traction all outside minor immediacy business mean u consumer ultimately notice price quality difference think continue grow gt gt spoke closure southern florida opening spoke matter distance closer customer therefore better economics that s entire explanation gt gt yeah think kroger opened three site they ve said benefit hindsight maybe opened them far away processing site based strong growth see else they re trading need open geography fill site near future therefore serve longer distance got longer cut time significantly higher cost term trunking distance sell closer sell closer gain benefit increased density geography well got ability sell it smart move learn experience needing close them rodney saying going open another one florida obviously leverage site grovelands location that s materially closer cfc original spoke site gt gt last question mark term size there s confusion size contract attempting sign akata technology orca intelligent automation range contract pursuing range pound sign dollar sign contract pursuing check main business gt gt i d say give you think real range probably smallest project we ve taken seriously far around million largest probably topping little pretty wide range actually that s quite whole range asrs deal market smaller bigger said cover them gt gt thank you gt gt luke holbrook morgan stanley first question refinancing interested hear left late refinance first december million bond gt gt think we ve left late think view we ve got pretty good existing debt structure pretty low cost capital let one run think look market today well are we ve got strong equity story market believe much open generally u confident executing go current that s logic gt gt understood second question eon signed third cfc deal interested hear term deal fee structure first two different fee structure gt gt same gt gt same gt gt final question would nongrocery side guided deal potentially per annum interested hear whether still applies year given pipeline suggesting gt gt that s definitely still possibility year obviously deep insight whether business we re pitching win year ca nt tell many deal might win that s definitely possibility gt gt understood thank you gt gt william wood bernstein first one phoenix charlotte actually go ahead kroger open need wait kroger say go gt gt ultimately day site open client say going live going live ca nt make call strong belief site going live gt gt understood obvious said online grocery penetration increasing look international module had think one nothing drawdown last six month seen drawdown would expect see beyond new cfc coming live next six month gt gt actually module drawdown last six see module drawdown remainder year gt gt module closed well gt gt there s one module exclusivity canada able return one world situation we ve net switch over drawing down mentioned already monroe module expect see continued growth site well expect growth second half expect material growth compared said last time present open one that s end game turn on prospective client got quite large business could take site put immediately bit like luton that s obviously ideal scenario people building new business obviously they ve got start build up ideally we d like build linear fashion actually realistic they ll build exponential fashion way business grow percentage always talk percentage last year look forward site see number starting want draw down gt gt excellent going back cash flow seminar think talking getting module mid term look like slide showing module fy potentially exponential improvement etc kept guidance tech support overhead flat versus seminar said free cash there s clear roadmap fy missing piece feel like logically consistent gt gt put lot range around free call like midpoint showed model well lot depends well mhe capex assume year well visibility around capex visibility around go life two key difference would say presented cash flow seminar basic economics remain dynamic talked then gt gt i m going add though remain probably slightly improved revenue side improved reimagined technology we re successful bringing engineering cloud cost margin existing live module would forecast stronger forecasting that right number module would forecasting probably le still expect get there taking bit longer what s happened market margin make product better result work we ve done investing product strong result gt gt excellent thank you gt gt one thanks charles thorne jeffries three question too first one tim bit mid level high level question obviously calling two headwind partner behavior existing potential partner food inflation obviously extracting best performance kit would say bigger influence partner behavior recent past reverse evolve move forward recognizing obviously one s really control one something influence building second question bit specific might segue we ve seen eon come third cfc little month maybe month since green bean went live anything early stage green bean economics efficiency performance accelerated third cfc decision hopper very long time lastly one stephen well maybe tim too improving retail performance how s influencing negotiation negotiating leverage mn gt gt i m going go reverse order might ask remind asked me we re commenting beyond fact we ve got ongoing conversation think said today constructive conversation got great working relationship day strategy meeting orl recently relationship mn strong think archie put nicely joint venture sometimes difficult moment difficult moment we re working together mature way conversation confidential ongoing term question i m remembering first question about think influence growth around market sectoral trend around u working closely partner they re improving operation stuff think bit both think online market growing went couple year decline even absolute volume suggest move towards automation probably hold back making decision whilst see stabilizes going continue growing think one interesting number basket size starting actually slightly stronger orl before basket size falling actually bigger driver loss volume orl saw strong trajectory inaudible growth there think stable economic environment stable pricing wage input price like energy stuff like that easier business make investment decision underlying growth sector term online channel shift that s positive what s definitely also influence true simple phenomenal brick mortar retailer buying great software robot ocado putting together that s like bringing ingredient bringing oven expecting fantastic product end also need chef middle think we re working together partner help leverage brilliant thing bring leverage bring party well together get that deliver outstanding offer shopper so grow efficiently grow economically sustainable ultimately profitable way that s we re believe deliver strong result future middle part question gt gt evidence green bean gt gt look again talk individual client s economics evidence growth obviously decided commit warehouse large warehouse tokyo big metropolitan area extremely big metropolitan area they ve got big ambition obviously they re happy progress they ve made date make decision gt gt thanks charles allen bloomberg intelligence three technical question first much improvement technology profit could attributed basically empty module one charging million presumably little cost anymore secondly cash flow forecast assuming retail ebita contribution cash flow forecast even deconsolidated then gt gt could take one time that s okay first one hatfield fee million year cost structure dissimilar warehouse there s million would operating cost live imagine there s still bit going we ve got unwind we ve got dismantle facility etc i m sure exactly much transfer in there s element there huge amount it next question wa gt gt next question forecast positive cash flow include retail ebitda contribution gt gt yes doe gt gt pretty modest number give precise number know ocado retail cash generative today generates pretty modest ebitda insufficient cover lease cost capital recharges ocado group doe short answer question modest amount gt gt thirdly considering asset backed financing solution refinance debt next month i gt gt think definitely something horizon future site interest u historical option historical definitely something people talking u future site existing potentially new client get mic way side we ve got another one side like that gt gt thank you inaudible coley ubs really couple question please i ll go one one think first one talked structural impediment reaching profitability client guess maybe could talk couple key issue partnership success trying solve get there particular side client really getting close targeted economics obviously need go detail helpful gt gt powered upon success highlighting certain decision could fall either side showed one earlier range people intuitively think well i ll put range that s average supermarket area opposed to i ll put differentiated larger range put every product that s available supermarket area i ll go find thing wider appeal whether that s specific ethnic product wider range organic premium product whatever might be ocado retail done

partner see material improvement helping drive behavior outcome want see partner want see gt gt thank you second one term technology solution midterm ebitda margin could talk much improvement going driven contribution versus direct operating cost time thank you gt gt they re going evolve mean margin hiding decent ebitda margin technology solution think operational leverage strong will course depend number live module go live module contribution around â million per module take technology cost probably â million pnl number similarly support cost well around see operational leverage business mid high single ten percent ebitda margin gt gt look think seen think number put today percent term marginal contribution expect reimagine revenue increase despite incremental automation roll

largely result also guiding better ebitda solution what s delta much additional epdr dropping through that s first question gt gt delta working capital ocado retail growing business working capital requirement growing key delta math actually highlighted two key driver that s key difference gt gt perfect maybe second question good visibility new cfc s ramping term additional disclosure example lot client basically saying online sale client really doing many current cfc profitable think would really help hugely really extrapolate draw line guess wider discussion maybe word this gt gt challenge here appreciate smart every time tried work disclose around total site utilization stuff see way apply read client number client clear number disclose disclose think get bigger number site live client might actually able transparent without trying back out well what s kroger s share what s one share what s one share know obviously everybody would love see disclosure around client facility profitability profitability u discus disclose obviously disclose margin generate site disclose cost u serving average site said absolutely u sit start discussing whether think one client s warehouse profitable not even even disclosure see cost line thing like that always see full operating margin estimate certain data data asked disclose gt gt thought maybe aggregate asking specific number done gt gt challenging aggregate moment given relative size ocado retail disclose kroger question easy deduce try end position disclosing something someone else s data gt gt fair enough lastly maybe krogers obviously we ve seen statement highlighting starlett phoenix going come gt gt i m highlighting gt gt basically two cfc specifically krogers coming redraw line basically indication delay kroger cfc today gt gt we ve previously spoken about we re talking cfc etc hope talking future right we re seeing strong growth rodney spoke about think said near doubling last quarter versus quarter last year think that s important number highlight fastest growing part see data business obviously near doubling come demand module existing site long think site despite fact offer extra capacity them still nevertheless become full think watch space let s see happens next gt gt point clarity a well think said phoenix charlotte they re gt gt even better gt gt sorry yeah gt gt hi sarah robert barclays thank taking question firstly mentioned good visibility module rollout fy module end year additional would helpful perspective get indication give confidence visibility midterm given we re seeing side obviously kroger sobeys slowing rollout suppose question is give confidence additional module going get pushed beyond fy timeline gt gt think look number we re putting out effect somewhat conservative term see what s coming committed module live site unsigned deal going live addition behind incremental module site already live see growth already rolling incremental module site already achieved utilization module they re already paying for obviously see site site say okay well one going need already ha going hit three month going hit six month nine month month add up expect need see large reaction forthcoming enhancement we re bringing platform in example we re suddenly saying well shortly time order going give u huge win that s what s going get u number think we ve got upside doe think we ve got strong confidence based rollout site know going live plus module see getting drawn get number gt gt hear you that s helpful thank you quickly oia appreciate early day sale pitch participating moment initial feedback client pitching technology compare peer auto store would helpful incremental color gt gt feedback generally positive guess obviously we re winning every bid enter expect case guess made point earlier fact play particularly strongly larger project we re going smaller project we re strong yet future an auto store particular lot project really small right bottom end market moment there would say we re quite competitive we d like be come bit volume general way guess put color positive feedback people really love solution widely deployed already easily demonstratable huge scale like really enormous throughput scale ocado think mentioned talking speak tremendous confidence solution capable operate take somewhere exactly say tin offer expertise make sure get result people responding positively deep wide knowledge operate automation scale gt gt extremely rare automation project find people achieve written tin signed contract we ve explained morning we re taking potential module live site beyond original design criterion able demonstrate show really unusual gt gt thank you gt gt hi inaudible oaa again picking last comment comment pricing term competitiveness smaller warehouse maybe is could give little bit color that sale effort oaa always going direct effort see partnering solution make sense warehouse whilst mic might well chuck in chance could give u utilization rate range cfc live gt gt last one recently gone live they re extremely low right needing draw module they re drawn capacity wide range think they ve public saying they re drawn now think original seven one kroger site give idea drawing quarter module continue draw down that s high end uk site utilization obviously high varies low they re growing gt gt oaa point i ll reverse order well second question whether always sell direct answer that think no intention always develop integrated reseller channel would say impression made trade show generated lot demand that weekly conversation wide basket integrator resellers ever since exhibited first trade show february late stage project bid we re currently involved project integrator brought u asked could deploy automation project expect going forward healthy mixture both i d like still direct project ocado capability bring something special bear especially project become large definitely nurture think quite big integrated channel long run would expect project done integrator ocado direct sure probably quite large margin point pricing yes like fact we re competitive large scale small scale pricing issue largely borne fact grew grocery volume very high element ocado solution optimized high throughput small deal like auto store many throughput le concern like certainly kind throughput able generate grocery ocado already working lower cost version one two peripheral suitable end market compared very high volume throughput like grocery world came from gt gt quick question me kroger reported sale

cash flow positive absolute focus helping partner become leading online grocery retailer best serve shopper leverage structural growth opportunity resumption channel shift we ll shift question go ahead marcus gt gt sorry wait mic gt gt that s coming gt gt hi marcus inaudible jp morgan three question maybe first one stephen number we re seeing guiding million le capex guiding million cash flow largely result also guiding better ebitda solution what s delta much additional epdr dropping through that s first question gt gt delta working capital ocado retail growing business working capital requirement growing key delta math actually highlighted two key driver that s key difference gt gt perfect maybe second question good visibility new cfc s ramping term additional disclosure example lot client basically saying online sale client really doing many current cfc profitable think would really help hugely really extrapolate draw line guess wider discussion maybe word this gt gt challenge here appreciate smart every time tried work disclose around total site utilization stuff see way apply read client number client clear number disclose disclose think get bigger number site live client might actually able transparent without trying back out well what s kroger s share what s one share what s one share know obviously everybody would love see disclosure around client facility profitability profitability u discus disclose obviously disclose margin generate site disclose cost u serving average site said absolutely u sit start discussing whether think one client s warehouse profitable not even even disclosure see cost line thing like that always see full operating margin estimate certain data data asked disclose gt gt thought maybe aggregate asking specific number done gt gt challenging aggregate moment given relative size ocado retail disclose kroger question easy deduce try end position disclosing something someone else s data gt gt fair enough lastly maybe krogers obviously we ve seen statement highlighting starlett phoenix going come gt gt i m highlighting gt gt basically two cfc specifically krogers coming redraw line basically indication delay kroger cfc today gt gt we ve previously spoken about we re talking cfc etc hope talking future right we re seeing strong growth rodney spoke about think said near doubling last quarter versus quarter last year think that s important number highlight fastest growing part see data business obviously near doubling come demand module existing site long think site despite fact offer extra capacity them still nevertheless become full think watch space let s see happens next gt gt point clarity a well think said phoenix charlotte they re gt gt even better gt gt sorry yeah gt gt hi sarah robert barclays thank taking question firstly mentioned good visibility module rollout fy module end year additional would helpful perspective get indication give confidence visibility midterm given we re seeing side obviously kroger sobeys slowing rollout suppose question is give confidence additional module going get pushed beyond fy timeline gt gt think look number we re putting out effect somewhat conservative term see what s coming committed module live site unsigned deal going live addition behind incremental module site already live see growth already rolling incremental module site already achieved utilization module they re already paying for obviously see site site say okay well one going need already ha going hit three month going hit six month nine month month add up expect need see large reaction forthcoming enhancement we re bringing platform in example we re suddenly saying well shortly time order going give u huge win that s what s going get u number think we ve got upside doe think we ve got strong confidence based rollout site know going live plus module see getting drawn get number gt gt hear you that s helpful thank you quickly oia appreciate early day sale pitch participating moment initial feedback client pitching technology compare peer auto store would helpful incremental color gt gt feedback generally positive guess obviously we re winning every bid enter expect case guess made point earlier fact play particularly strongly larger project we re going smaller project we re strong yet future an auto store particular lot project really small right bottom end market moment there would say we re quite competitive we d like be come bit volume general way guess put color positive feedback people really love solution widely deployed already easily demonstratable huge scale like really enormous throughput scale ocado think mentioned talking speak tremendous confidence solution capable operate take somewhere exactly say tin offer expertise make sure get result people responding positively deep wide knowledge operate automation scale gt gt extremely rare automation project find people achieve written tin signed contract we ve explained morning we re taking potential module live site beyond original design criterion able demonstrate show really unusual gt gt thank you gt gt hi inaudible oaa again picking last comment comment pricing term competitiveness smaller warehouse maybe is could give little bit color that sale effort oaa always going direct effort see partnering solution make sense warehouse whilst mic might well chuck in chance could give u utilization rate range cfc live gt gt last one recently gone live they re extremely low right needing draw module they re drawn capacity wide range think they ve public saying they re drawn now think original seven one kroger site give idea drawing quarter module continue draw down that s high end uk site utilization obviously high varies low they re growing gt gt oaa point i ll reverse order well second question whether always sell direct answer that think no intention always develop integrated reseller channel would say impression made trade show generated lot demand that weekly conversation wide basket integrator resellers ever since exhibited first trade show february late stage project bid we re currently involved project integrator brought u asked could deploy automation project expect going forward healthy mixture both i d like still direct project ocado capability bring something special bear especially project become large definitely nurture think quite big integrated channel long run would expect project done integrator ocado direct sure probably quite large margin point pricing yes like fact we re competitive large scale small scale pricing issue largely borne fact grew grocery volume very high element ocado solution optimized high throughput small deal like auto store many throughput le concern like certainly kind throughput able generate grocery ocado already working lower cost version one two peripheral suitable end market compared very high volume throughput like grocery world came from gt gt quick question me kroger reported sale using delivery system grew nearly overall growth suggesting two channel pursue store fulfillment using company sledge instacart barely growing case able grow much faster two channel sustainable it gt gt guess alice talk part growth talk rest company s growth ronnie pointed out shopper love service np score strong fulfillment rate higher achieve store think there s still long way go kroger fulfillment rate they re best class yet alongside client element endtoend solution use software that s bearing that come we ll see improvement come overall u grew different way know term market crowd sourced independent people bringing grocery car walk supermarket collect them number substitution missing item customer u used compared service delivering quality arriving white glove service chilled van arriving outside house dedicated employee client kroger delivering uniform different experience many u consumer think feedback strong they re seeing strong growth number site strong growth gt gt believe doable term growth rate gt gt look yes definitely going grow strongly know exactly strongly mean we re expecting enhance tam addressed short lead time order think impact strongest felt u market elsewhere u market grew heavy labor model instacart disadvantage every major factor term range pricing freshness accuracy one selling point immediacy shortly time order coming model address immediacy whilst time maintaining chillchain maintaining choice maintaining accuracy much cost effective operate believe partner offer materially lower price team feeding back u done pricing comparison ordering kroger delivery versus ordering kroger s site getting instacart delivery ordering kroger instacart there s material cost difference u think least price sensitive market know think someone came service uk price premium see instacart u would get traction all outside minor immediacy business mean u consumer ultimately notice price quality difference think continue grow gt gt spoke closure southern florida opening spoke matter distance closer customer therefore better economics that s entire explanation gt gt yeah think kroger opened three site they ve said benefit hindsight maybe opened them far away processing site based strong growth see else they re trading need open geography fill site near future therefore serve longer distance got longer cut time significantly higher cost term trunking distance sell closer sell closer gain benefit increased density geography well got ability sell it smart move learn experience needing close them rodney saying going open another one florida obviously leverage site grovelands location that s materially closer cfc original spoke site gt gt last question mark term size there s confusion size contract attempting sign akata technology orca intelligent automation range contract pursuing range pound sign dollar sign contract pursuing check main business gt gt i d say give you think real range probably smallest project we ve taken seriously far around million largest probably topping little pretty wide range actually that s quite whole range asrs deal market smaller bigger said cover them gt gt thank you gt gt luke holbrook morgan stanley first question refinancing interested hear left late refinance first december million bond gt gt think we ve left late think view we ve got pretty good existing debt structure pretty low cost capital let one run think look market today well are we ve got strong equity story market believe much open generally u confident executing go current that s logic gt gt understood second question eon signed third cfc deal interested hear term deal fee structure first two different fee structure gt gt same gt gt same gt gt final question would nongrocery side guided deal potentially per annum interested hear whether still applies year given pipeline suggesting gt gt that s definitely still possibility year obviously deep insight whether business we re pitching win year ca nt tell many deal might win that s definitely possibility gt gt understood thank you gt gt william wood bernstein first one phoenix charlotte actually go ahead kroger open need wait kroger say go gt gt ultimately day site open client say going live going live ca nt make call strong belief site going live gt gt understood obvious said online grocery penetration increasing look international module had think one nothing drawdown last six month seen drawdown would expect see beyond new cfc coming live next six month gt gt actually module drawdown last six see module drawdown remainder year gt gt module closed well gt gt there s one module exclusivity canada able return one world situation we ve net switch over drawing down mentioned already monroe module expect see continued growth site well expect growth second half expect material growth compared said last time present open one that s end game turn on prospective client got quite large business could take site put immediately bit like luton that s obviously ideal scenario people building new business obviously they ve got start build up ideally we d like build linear fashion actually realistic they ll build exponential fashion way business grow percentage always talk percentage last year look forward site see number starting want draw down gt gt excellent going back cash flow seminar think talking getting module mid term look like slide showing module fy potentially exponential improvement etc kept guidance tech support overhead flat versus seminar said free cash there s clear roadmap fy missing piece feel like logically consistent gt gt put lot range around free call like midpoint showed model well lot depends well mhe capex assume year well visibility around capex visibility around go life two key difference would say presented cash flow seminar basic economics remain dynamic talked then gt gt i m going add though remain probably slightly improved revenue side improved reimagined technology we re successful bringing engineering cloud cost margin existing live module would forecast stronger forecasting that right number module would forecasting probably le still expect get there taking bit longer what s happened market margin make product better result work we ve done investing product strong result gt gt excellent thank you gt gt one thanks charles thorne jeffries three question too first one tim bit mid level high level question obviously calling two headwind partner behavior existing potential partner food inflation obviously extracting best performance kit would say bigger influence partner behavior recent past reverse evolve move forward recognizing obviously one s really control one something influence building second question bit specific might segue we ve seen eon come third cfc little month maybe month since green bean went live anything early stage green bean economics efficiency performance accelerated third cfc decision hopper very long time lastly one stephen well maybe tim too improving retail performance how s influencing negotiation negotiating leverage mn gt gt i m going go reverse order might ask remind asked me we re commenting beyond fact we ve got ongoing conversation think said today constructive conversation got great working relationship day strategy meeting orl recently relationship mn strong think archie put nicely joint venture sometimes difficult moment difficult moment we re working together mature way conversation confidential ongoing term question i m remembering first question about think influence growth around market sectoral trend around u working closely partner they re improving operation stuff think bit both think online market growing went couple year decline even absolute volume suggest move towards automation probably hold back making decision whilst see stabilizes going continue growing think one interesting number basket size starting actually slightly stronger orl before basket size falling actually bigger driver loss volume orl saw strong trajectory inaudible growth there think stable economic environment stable pricing wage input price like energy stuff like that easier business make investment decision underlying growth sector term online channel shift that s positive what s definitely also influence true simple phenomenal brick mortar retailer buying great software robot ocado putting together that s like bringing ingredient bringing oven expecting fantastic product end also need chef middle think we re working together partner help leverage brilliant thing bring leverage bring party well together get that deliver outstanding offer shopper so grow efficiently grow economically sustainable ultimately profitable way that s we re believe deliver strong result future middle part question gt gt evidence green bean gt gt look again talk individual client s economics evidence growth obviously decided commit warehouse large warehouse tokyo big metropolitan area extremely big metropolitan area they ve got big ambition obviously they re happy progress they ve made date make decision gt gt thanks charles allen bloomberg intelligence three technical question first much improvement technology profit could attributed basically empty module one charging million presumably little cost anymore secondly cash flow forecast assuming retail ebita contribution cash flow forecast even deconsolidated then gt gt could take one time that s okay first one hatfield fee million year cost structure dissimilar warehouse there s million would operating cost live imagine there s still bit going we ve got unwind we ve got dismantle facility etc i m sure exactly much transfer in there s element there huge amount it next question wa gt gt next question forecast positive cash flow include retail ebitda contribution gt gt yes doe gt gt pretty modest number give precise number know ocado retail cash generative today generates pretty modest ebitda insufficient cover lease cost capital recharges ocado group doe short answer question modest amount gt gt thirdly considering asset backed financing solution refinance debt next month i gt gt think definitely something horizon future site interest u historical option historical definitely something people talking u future site existing potentially new client get mic way side we ve got another one side like that gt gt thank you inaudible coley ubs really couple question please i ll go one one think first one talked structural impediment reaching profitability client guess maybe could talk couple key issue partnership success trying solve get there particular side client really getting close targeted economics obviously need go detail helpful gt gt powered upon success highlighting certain decision could fall either side showed one earlier range people intuitively think well i ll put range that s average supermarket area opposed to i ll put differentiated larger range put every product that s available supermarket area i ll go find thing wider appeal whether that s specific ethnic product wider range organic premium product whatever might be ocado retail done well year able show people data show impact like that may nothing partner success trying persuade retailer supply chain retail team go that thing drive basket size improve acquisition improve retention improve frequency improve medium medium another area number client existing business create medium opportunity ocado retail s medium tape year â million percentage sale probably global average profitability partner yet gone money helping understand that s for use tool sell tool go talk to around supply chain minimize waste whilst time keeping extremely high level availability around discussing pricing promotional strategy try avoid promoting slab cheap water fill van try persuade people sell loose banana well labor planning trying help people get machinery utilize efficiently route geography route tradeoff availability releasing van labor planning lot area we re seeing positive result number place expect see more we ve got team deployed locally we ve got ten people deployed helping u we ve got people moving world wherever we re helping wherever together partner people making change they re seeing positive impact improving productivity warehouse improving drop per eighthour route van improving labor utilization improving supply chain availability improving waste improving acquisition retention literally across board work together critical work together partner see material improvement helping drive behavior outcome want see partner want see gt gt thank you second one term technology solution midterm ebitda margin could talk much improvement going driven contribution versus direct operating cost time thank you gt gt they re going evolve mean margin hiding decent ebitda margin technology solution think operational leverage strong will course depend number live module go live module contribution around â million per module take technology cost probably â million pnl number similarly support cost well around see operational leverage business mid high single ten percent ebitda margin gt gt look think seen think number put today percent term marginal contribution expect reimagine revenue increase despite incremental automation roll out still expect operating cost come quite away today expect margin move pointing out much we re versus central fixed gt gt thank you gt gt think we re done thank much everybody thank
