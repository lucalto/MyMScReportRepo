 how the development of awaruite deposits in canada may help
 alleviate projected shortages of nickel concentrate

     financialnewsmediacom news commentary  the refining of sulfide
nickel deposits usually requires a smelting capacity not present in north
america it is controlled by china smelting is an environmentally harmful
process worse than c02 that can cause environmental damage water air
tailings from sulphide minerals in mining waste have the potential to
create acid china controls 6880 of nickel refining smelting and
controls 84 of the indonesia nickel market a report from the brookings
institute said that even if the us and eu were to dig more minerals out
of the ground many of these minerals would need to be shipped overseas for
concentrating refining and smelting without significant increases in us
and european mineral refining and smelting capacity the us in
particular will likely have to update and amend its mining regulatory
regime governments will also have to onshore or friendshore smelting and
refining capacity the midstream part of the equation is likely to be the
most challenging complicated by high investment costs and market
conditions active companies mentioned in the article include first

general motors co nyse gm tmc the metals company inc nasdaq tmc

     the us government usgs sees a better way saying the development
of awaruite deposits in other parts of canada may help alleviate any
prolonged shortage of nickel concentrate awaruite a natural ironnickel
alloy is much easier to concentrate than pentlandite the principal
sulfide of nickel awaruite is safer and more economical to process due to
the magnetic separation and concentration it uses less chemicals less
energy can be processed directly in north america and since no smelting is
required doesnt need to go to china awaruite means no burning which
releases sulfur dioxide and other toxic emissions and less risk of acid
mine tailings accidents or contaminations no sulphide minerals present

     a report from science direct said nickel is an important component of
stainless steel and a wide range of applications which are critical for the
transition to clean energies including electric vehicle batteries awaruite
is a native nickeliron alloy that has gained interest as a possible new
economic source of nickel in the last decades there have been discoveries
of awaruite mostly with more significant amounts of nickel sulphides that
have demonstrated the potential for awaruite to contribute to the economics
of a deposit this study is focused on the very large baptiste deposit in
central british columbia canada where awaruite is the primary nickel
mineral it concluded awaruite has the potential to be concentrated in a
unique and valuable nickel concentrate of distinctive characteristics
including its very high nickel content which lowers both the downstream
costs and the carbon intensity furthermore the negligible content of
sulphur and penalty trace elements such as mercury antimony and arsenic
in a potential awaruite concentrate minimizes the costs of refining it

pleased to provide an update on the progress at its whollyowned atlantic
nickel project in central newfoundland canada the project or the
atlantic nickel project the company recently completed the first site
visit with a strategic corporate investor the strategic investor which
included examining nickelbearing occurrences and historical drill core
first atlantic welcomes the strategic investors support knowledge and
experience in mining project exploration and development

     highlights

st

   first site visit at atlantic nickel project with corporate strategic
investor completed
   awaruite identified as visible grains in previous drill core from
atlantic lake area
   first bridge installed as part of road upgrade and development program
enabling yearround project access
   technical advisor dr ron britten has conducted a site visit to
examine awaruite nickel occurrences and will help lead the charge to
discover a potential large scale deposit
   permits filed for phase 2 of new allweather road construction
   geological team with awaruite experience expanded to accelerate
districtscale exploration efforts along extensive 30 km trend

et

     project road update first atlantic is also pleased to announce the
installation of the first bridge as part of its infrastructure upgrade
program on the project the company anticipates the completion of two
additional bridges allowing for the establishment of operations directly
on the project site enhancing future operational efficiency

     the installation of the first bridge marks a significant milestone in
conducting largescale districtsize mining exploration operations the
road will provide faster and closer access to additional awaruite zones
throughout the district allowing for yearround exploration work and
drilling improved road access reduces the cost per meter of drilling
enabling significantly more drilling activities

     exploration updates preparations are underway for the exploration
camp with a permit in place the camp will serve as a strategic base for
onsite operations enabling the exploration team to work efficiently in
the field to ensure yearround access to the site road upgrades are being
implemented allowing for easy ground access regardless of the season

     the exploration program is focusing on grading and prioritizing
awaruite outcrops as well as sampling and mapping prospective drill
targets along the 30km trend a lidarphotos airborne program is also being
planned to aid in this work providing highresolution topographic data and
aerial imagery the lidar data will help identify key geological
structures while the aerial photos will be used to visually identify
outcrops for the geological team to investigate on the ground this
integrated approach will further support exploration and development
efforts

     technical advisor dr ron britten has completed an initial site
visit and is working closely with the first atlantic exploration team
onsite with his decades of experience including discovering the baptiste
awaruite deposit containing over 10 billion pounds of nickel dr britten
will enhance the program dr brittens efforts will help outline the best
occurrences for targeting in the initial drill program planned for this
year this largescale district sampling program can continue during the
road construction phase necessary for full drilling operations continued

 how the development of awaruite deposits in canada may help
 alleviate projected shortages of nickel concentrate

     financialnewsmediacom news commentary  the refining of sulfide
nickel deposits usually requires a smelting capacity not present in north
america it is controlled by china smelting is an environmentally harmful
process worse than c02 that can cause environmental damage water air
tailings from sulphide minerals in mining waste have the potential to
create acid china controls 6880 of nickel refining smelting and
controls 84 of the indonesia nickel market a report from the brookings
institute said that even if the us and eu were to dig more minerals out
of the ground many of these minerals would need to be shipped overseas for
concentrating refining and smelting without significant increases in us
and european mineral refining and smelting capacity the us in
particular will likely have to update and amend its mining regulatory
regime governments will also have to onshore or friendshore smelting and
refining capacity the midstream part of the equation is likely to be the
most challenging complicated by high investment costs and market
conditions active companies mentioned in the article include first

general motors co nyse gm tmc the metals company inc nasdaq tmc

     the us government usgs sees a better way saying the development
of awaruite deposits in other parts of canada may help alleviate any
prolonged shortage of nickel concentrate awaruite a natural ironnickel
alloy is much easier to concentrate than pentlandite the principal
sulfide of nickel awaruite is safer and more economical to process due to
the magnetic separation and concentration it uses less chemicals less
energy can be processed directly in north america and since no smelting is
required doesnt need to go to china awaruite means no burning which
releases sulfur dioxide and other toxic emissions and less risk of acid
mine tailings accidents or contaminations no sulphide minerals present

     a report from science direct said nickel is an important component of
stainless steel and a wide range of applications which are critical for the
transition to clean energies including electric vehicle batteries awaruite
is a native nickeliron alloy that has gained interest as a possible new
economic source of nickel in the last decades there have been discoveries
of awaruite mostly with more significant amounts of nickel sulphides that
have demonstrated the potential for awaruite to contribute to the economics
of a deposit this study is focused on the very large baptiste deposit in
central british columbia canada where awaruite is the primary nickel
mineral it concluded awaruite has the potential to be concentrated in a
unique and valuable nickel concentrate of distinctive characteristics
including its very high nickel content which lowers both the downstream
costs and the carbon intensity furthermore the negligible content of
sulphur and penalty trace elements such as mercury antimony and arsenic
in a potential awaruite concentrate minimizes the costs of refining it

strategic investor site visit expands geological team and reports
milestones on infrastructure upgrades at atlantic nickel project  first
atlantic nickel corp fse p21 first atlantic or the company is
pleased to provide an update on the progress at its whollyowned atlantic
nickel project in central newfoundland canada the project or the
atlantic nickel project the company recently completed the first site
visit with a strategic corporate investor the strategic investor which
included examining nickelbearing occurrences and historical drill core
first atlantic welcomes the strategic investors support knowledge and
experience in mining project exploration and development

     highlights

st

   first site visit at atlantic nickel project with corporate strategic
investor completed
   awaruite identified as visible grains in previous drill core from
atlantic lake area
   first bridge installed as part of road upgrade and development program
enabling yearround project access
   technical advisor dr ron britten has conducted a site visit to
examine awaruite nickel occurrences and will help lead the charge to
discover a potential large scale deposit
   permits filed for phase 2 of new allweather road construction
   geological team with awaruite experience expanded to accelerate
districtscale exploration efforts along extensive 30 km trend

et

     project road update first atlantic is also pleased to announce the
installation of the first bridge as part of its infrastructure upgrade
program on the project the company anticipates the completion of two
additional bridges allowing for the establishment of operations directly
on the project site enhancing future operational efficiency

     the installation of the first bridge marks a significant milestone in
conducting largescale districtsize mining exploration operations the
road will provide faster and closer access to additional awaruite zones
throughout the district allowing for yearround exploration work and
drilling improved road access reduces the cost per meter of drilling
enabling significantly more drilling activities

     exploration updates preparations are underway for the exploration
camp with a permit in place the camp will serve as a strategic base for
onsite operations enabling the exploration team to work efficiently in
the field to ensure yearround access to the site road upgrades are being
implemented allowing for easy ground access regardless of the season

     the exploration program is focusing on grading and prioritizing
awaruite outcrops as well as sampling and mapping prospective drill
targets along the 30km trend a lidarphotos airborne program is also being
planned to aid in this work providing highresolution topographic data and
aerial imagery the lidar data will help identify key geological
structures while the aerial photos will be used to visually identify
outcrops for the geological team to investigate on the ground this
integrated approach will further support exploration and development
efforts

     technical advisor dr ron britten has completed an initial site
visit and is working closely with the first atlantic exploration team
onsite with his decades of experience including discovering the baptiste
awaruite deposit containing over 10 billion pounds of nickel dr britten
will enhance the program dr brittens efforts will help outline the best
occurrences for targeting in the initial drill program planned for this
year this largescale district sampling program can continue during the
road construction phase necessary for full drilling operations continued

video transcript
the sampp 500 and nasdaq ended a bumpy session weaker on thursday failing to regain ground lost in the previous days techtriggered selloff the dow added 020 the sampp lost 050 and the nasdaq fell more than 090 all three indexes were up for most of the session on the heels of strongerthanexpected second quarter gdp data megacap stocks traded higher midafternoon only to fall later in the day with meta platforms microsoft and nvidia all ending lower lackluster earnings from both tesla and alphabet had pummeled magnificent seven stocks a day earlier causing the sampp and nasdaq to log their worst day since 2022 alphabets shares dipped again on thursday falling 3 to the stocks lowest close since may 6 but tesla rebounded 2 four more megacap tech companies report earnings next week but while brad bernstein managing director at ubs private wealth management called their results critical its the rest of the market hes excited about
so we actually think the big story in earnings season this month will be the fact that for the first time in two years were going to have earnings growth in the nonmagnificent seven of the sampp 500 so the 493 other stocks that have had no earnings growth as collectively over the last several years are finally going to have earnings growth and we think that bodes very well for the rally to continue because earnings are now growing from other areas within the market
among earningsdriven moves ibm shares jumped more than 4 after the tech company beat estimates for second quarter revenue and raised the annual growth forecast for its software business shares of american airlines rose more than 4 after the company said it had taken swift action to reset its sales and distribution strategy which had driven away corporate travelers meanwhile shares of southwest airlines climbed 55 after saying it would end open seating on its flights on the flip side ford shares plummeted more than 18 after the automakers second quarter adjusted profit missed estimates by a wide marginc copyright thomson reuters 2024 click for restrictions  httpaboutreuterscomfulllegalasp",2024-07-26,Ford,social

us secondquarter gdp surprises to the upside welcome to trading at noon i am thomas warner data showed the us economy grew faster than expected in the second quarter annualized growth of 28 came in well above estimates of 20 but inflation as measured by the core pce price index subsided leaving expectations of a september rate cut intact separate report showed weekly jobless claims fell more than expected as distortions from the weather and temporary automobile plant closures faded turning to the equity markets now and the main us indexes opening mixed with the sampp and nasdaq dipping in and out of positive territory this after the nasdaq suffered its worst day since 2022 on wednesday investors assessed strongerthanexpected gdp data but remained cautious after suffering that tech mauling in the previous session us treasury yields meanwhile fell for a third day on thursday as investors piled into shorterdated bonds in anticipation of rate cuts the global selloff in tech stocks and other risk assets also fanned the push into safe haven assets the gap between 2year and 10year treasury yields hits its narrowest since october 2023 and was just a whisker below where it was in july 2022 in outright terms nvidia microsoft and apple were among this mornings heaviest fallers on the sampp 500 nvidia is down nearly 16 from its alltime high back in june meta alphabet and amazon all also traded lower but tesla bucked the trend up 3 after its worst day in nearly four years yesterday one analyst that we spoke to said that traders are reassessing the entire sector
i think there is some caution obviously alphabet did beat expectations but not by enough to create upward momentum in the stock and tesla had a pretty broadbased miss but ultimately i think there is a questioning of traders of how much more money is going to be needed to invest in ai and when is that payoff ultimately going to play out

question marks about global growth will prove to be problematic for the eurozone so we have seen those forwardlooking survey indicators retreating quite significantly expectations within the ifo survey dipped below the current reading and that is a rather negative backdrop so i think that does suggest that the euro macroeconomic projections are going to be challenged

life for the forces of civilization to triumph america and israel must stand together because when we stand together something very simple happens we win they lose and my friends i came to assure you today of one thing we will win ladies and gentlemen like december 7 1941 and september 11 2001 october 7 is a day that will forever live in infamy it was the jewish holiday of inaudible 001935 it began as a perfect day not a cloud in the sky thousands of young israelis were celebrating at an outdoor music festival and suddenly at 629 am as children were still sleeping soundly in their beds in the towns in kibbutzim next to gaza suddenly heaven turned into hell 3000 hamas terrorists stormed into israel they butchered 1200 people from 41 countries including 39 americans proportionately compared to our population size thats like 29 11s in one day and these monsters they rape women they beheaded men they burn babies alive they killed parents in front of their children and children in front of their parents they dragged 255 people both living and dead into the dark dungeons of gaza israel has already brought home 135 of these hostages including seven who were freed in daring rescue operations one of those freed hostages noa argamani is here in the gallery sitting near my wife sarah on the morning of october 7 the entire world saw noas look of desperation as she was violently abducted to gaza on the back of a motorcycle i met noas mother leora a few months ago she was dying of cancer she said to me prime minister i have one final wish i wish to hug my daughter noa one last time before i die two months ago i authorized a breathtaking commander rescue operation our special forces including a heroic officer named arnonz mora who fell in this battle rescued noa and three other hostages noa i think its one of the most moving things when noa was reunited with her mother leora and her mothers last wish came true noa were so thrilled to have you with us today thank you many hostage families are also here with us today including elial bibas elial bibas is the grandfather of those two beautiful redheaded boys the bibas boys toddlers and they were taken hostage with their mother and elials son the entire family was taken hostage two beautiful red haired children taken hostage what monsters and with us also is iris kaim whose son yotam bravely escaped hamas captivity with two other israelis and tragically they were killed making their way back to our lines we have with us also the families of american hostages theyre here the pain these families have endured is beyond words i met with them again yesterday and i promised them this i will not rest until all their loved ones are home all of them as we speak were actively engaged in intensive efforts to secure their release and im confident that these efforts can succeed some of them are taking place right now i want to thank president biden for his tireless efforts on behalf of the hostages and for his efforts to the hostage families as well i thank president biden for his heartfelt support for israel after the savage attack on october 7 he rightly called hamas sheer evil he dispatched two aircraft carriers to the middle east to deter a wider war and he came to israel to stand with us during our darkest hour a visit that will never be forgotten president biden and i have known each other for over 40 years i want to thank him for half a century of friendship to israel and for being as he says a proud zionist actually he says a proud irish american zionist my friends for more than nine months israels soldiers have shown boundless courage with us today is lieutenant avichal rueven avichal is an officer in the israeli paratroopers his family immigrated to israel from ethiopia in the early hours of october 7 abigail heard the news of hamass bloody rampage he put on his uniform grabbed his rifle but he didnt have a car so he ran eight miles to the front lines of gaza to defend his people you hear that he ran eight miles came to the front lines killed many terrorists and saved many lives avichal we all honor your remarkable heroism another israeli is with us here today and hes standing stand up right next to right next to avichal this is master sergeant ashraf fal bakeri ashraf is a veteran soldier from the israeli muslim community of rods on october 7 ashraf too killed many terrorists first he defended his comrades in the military base and he then rushed to defend the neighboring communities including the devastated community of kibbutz beeri like ashraf the muslim soldiers of the idf fought alongside their jewish drews christian and other comrades in arms with tremendous bravery a third hero lieutenant asa soper is also here with us asa fought as an officer in the tank corps and he was wounded in battle he was wounded in battle while protecting his fellow soldiers from a grenade he lost his right arm and the vision in his left eye hes recovering and incredibly within a short time asa will soon return to active duty as a commander of a tank company i just learned there is a fourth hero here lieutenant yantan jonathan benham who lost a leg in gaza and continued to fight my friends these are the soldiers of israel unbowd undaunted unafraid as the bible says am kv yaku they shall rise like lions they have risen like lions the lions of judah the lions of israel ladies and gentlemen the men and women of the idf come from every corner of israeli societies every ethnicity every color every crete left and right religious and secular all are imbued with the indomitable spirit of the macabes the legendary jewish warriors of antiquity with us today is yehel lighter the father of one of those macabes yehels father escaped the holocaust and found refuge in america as a young man yehel moved to israel and raised a family of eight children he named his eldest son moshe after his late father moshe became an exemplary officer in one of our elite commander units he served with distinction for two decades while raising six beautiful children of his own on october 7th moshe volunteered to return to combat four weeks later he was killed when a booby trapped mine exploded in a tunnel shaft right next to a mosque at his sons funeral yehel said this if the state of israel had not been established after the holocaust the image engraved in our collective memory would have been the photograph of that helpless jewish boy in the warsaw ghetto holding his hands up in the air with nazi rifles pointed at him but because of the birth of israel yehel continued because of the courage of soldiers like my son moshe the jewish people are no longer helpless in the face of our enemies yehel please rise so we can honor your sons sacrifice and i pledge to you and to all the bereaved families of israel some of who are in this hall today the sacrifice of your loved ones will not be in vain it will not be a vain because for israel never again must never be an empty promise it was always remain a sacred vow and after october 7th never again is now my friends defeating our brutal enemies requires both courage and clarity clarity begins by knowing the difference between good and evil yet incredibly many anti israel protesters many choose to stand with evil they stand with hamas they stand with rapists and murderers they stand with people who came into the kitim into a home the parents hit the children the two babies in the attic in a secret attic they murder the families the parents they find the secret latch to the hidden attic and then they murder the babies these protessors stand with them they should be ashamed of themselves they refused to make the simple distinction between those who target terrorists and those who target civilians between the democratic state of israel and the terrorist of hamas we recently learned from the national security director us director of national intelligence that iran is funding and promoting anti israel protests in america they want to disrupt america so these protesters burn american flags even on 4th july and i wish to salute the fraternity brothers at the university of north carolina who protected the american flag against these anti israel protesters for all we know iran is funding the anti israel protests that are going on right now outside this building not that many but theyre there and throughout the city well i have a message for these protesters when the tyrants of tehran who hang gas from cranes and murder women for not air appraising promoting and funding you you have officially become irans useful idiots some of these protesters and its amazing absolutely amazing some of these protesters hold up signs proclaiming gas for gaza they might as well hold up signs saying chickens for kfc these protesters chant from the river to the sea but many dont have a clue what river and what sea theyre talking about they not only get an f in geography they get an f in history they call israel they call israel a colonialist state dont they know that the land of israel is where ibrahim isaac and jacob prayed where isaiah and jeremiah preached and where david and solomon rule for nearly 4000 years the land of israel has been the homeland of the jewish people its always been our home it will always be our home its not only the campus protesters who get it wrong its also the people who run those campuses 80 years after the holocaust the presidents of harvard penn and im ashamed to say my alma mater mit couldnt bring themselves to condemn the calls for the genocide of jews do you remember what they said they said it depends on the context well let me give these befuddled academics a little context anti semitism is the worlds oldest hatred for centuries the massacre of jews was always preceded by wild accusations we were accused of everything from poisoning wills to spreading plagues to using the blood of slaughtered children to bake passover mazas these preposterous anti semitic lies led to persecution mass murder and ultimately to historys worst genocide the holocaust now just as malicious lies were leveled for centuries at the jewish people malicious lies are now being leveled at the jewish state no dont applaud listen the outrageous slanders that paint israel as racist and genocidal are meant to delegitimize israel to demonize the jewish state and to demonize jews everywhere and no wonder weve witnessed an appalling rise of anti semitism in america and around the world my friends whenever and wherever we see the scourge of anti semitism we must unequivocally condemn it and resolutely fight it without exception and dont be fooled when the blood libels against the jewish state come from people who wear fancy silk robes and speak in lofty tones about law and justice heres a case in point the prosecutor of the international criminal court has shamefully accused israel of deliberately starving the people of gaza this is utter complete nonsense its a complete fabrication israel has enabled more than 40008 trucks to enter gaza thats half a million tons of food and thats more than 3000 calories for every man woman and child in gaza if there are palestinians in gaza who arent getting enough food its not because israel is blocking it its because hamas is stealing it so much for that lie but heres another the icc prosecutor accuses israel of deliberately targeting civilians what in gods green earth is he talking about the idf has dropped millions of fliers sent millions of text messages made hundreds of thousands of phone calls to get palestinian civilians out of hamas way but at the same time hamas does everything in its power to put palestinian civilians in harms way they fire rockets from schools from hospitals from mosques they even shoot their own people when they try to leave the war zone a senior hamas official patri hamad boasted listen to this he boasted that palestinian women and children excel at being human shields his words excel at being human shields what monstrous evil for israel every civilian death is a tragedy for hamas its a strategy they actually want palestinian civilians to die so that israel will be smeared in the international media and be pressured to end the war before its won this would enable hamas to survive another day and as they vowed to carry out october 7th again and again well i want to assure you no matter what pressure is brought to bear i will never allow that to happen the vast majority of americans have not fallen for this hamas propaganda they continue to support israel and i want to say thank you america and thank you senators and house members who continue to support us continue to support israel continue to support the truth and see through the lies but as for the minority that may have fallen for hamas khans job i suggest you listen to colonel john spencer john spencer is head of urban warfare studies at west point he studied every major urban conflict i was going to say in modern history he corrected me no in history israel he said has implemented more precautions to prevent civilian harm than any military in history and beyond what international law requires applause thats why despite all the lies youve heard the war in gaza has one of the lowest ratios of combatants to non combatants casualties in the history of urban warfare and you want to know where its lowest in gaza its lowest in rafah remember what so many people said if israel goes into rafah thered be thousands maybe even 10s of thousands of civilians killed well last week i went into rafah i visited our troops as they finished fighting hamas remaining terrorist battalions i asked the commander there  how many terrorists did you take out in rafah he gave me an exact number 1203 i asked him how many civilians were killed he said prime minister practically none with the exception of a single incident where shrapnel from a bomb hit a hamas weapons depot and unintentionally killed two dozen people the answer is practically none you want to know why because israel got the civilians out of harms way something people said we could never do but we did it applause these heroes here today the heroic soldiers of israel should not be condemned for how theyre conducting the war in gaza they should be commended for itapplause i want to thank all of you here today who have forcefully opposed the false accusations of the icc and stood up for the truth these lies are not only libelous  theyre downright dangerous the icc is trying to shackle israels hands and prevent us from defending ourselves and if israels hands are tied america is next and ill tell you what else is next the ability of all democracies to fight terrorism will be imperlled thats whats on the line so let me assure you the hands of the jewish state will never be shackled israel will always defend itself my friends in the middle east iran is virtually beyond behind all the terrorism all the turmoil all the chaos all the killing and that should come as no surprise when he founded the islamic republic ayatollah khomeini pledged we will export our revolution to the entire world we will export the islamic revolution to the entire world now ask yourself which country ultimately stands in the way of irans maniacal plans to impose radical islam on the world and the answer is clear its america the guardian of western civilization and the worlds greatest power thats why iran sees america as its greatest enemy last month we had a revealing comment ostensibly about the war in gaza but about something else it came from the foreign minister of irans proxy hezbah and he said this this is not a war with israel israel he said is merely a tool the main war the real war is with america irans regime has been fighting america from the moment it came to power in 1979 it stormed the american embassy it held scores of americans hostage for 444 days since then irans terrorist proxies have targeted america in the middle east and beyond in beirut they killed 241 us servicemen in africa they bombed american embassies in iraq they supplied explosives to maim and kill thousands of american soldiers in america they actually sent death squads they sent death squads here to murder a former secretary of state and a former national security advisor and as we recently learned they even brazenly threatened to assassinate president trump but iran understands that to truly challenge america it must first conquer the middle east and for this it uses its many proxies including the houthis hezbollah and hamas yet in the heart of the middle east standing in irans way is one proud pro american democracy my country the state of israelapplause thats why the mobs in tehran chant death to israel before they chant death to america for iran israel is first america is next so when israel fights hamas were fighting iran when we fight hezbollah were fighting iran when we fight the houthis were fighting iran and when we fight iran were fighting the most radical and murderous enemy of the united states of america and one more thing when israel acts to prevent iran from developing nuclear weapons nuclear weapons that could destroy israel and threaten every american city every city that you come from were not only protecting ourselves were protecting you applause my friends if you remember one thing from the speech remember this our enemies are your enemies our fight is your fight and our victory will be your victoryapplause ladies and gentlemen that victory is in sight israels defeat of hamas will be a powerful blow to irans axis of terror another part of that axis hezbollah attacked israel on october 8 a day after the hamas attack it has launched thousands of missiles and drones against us 80000 of our citizens in northern israel evacuated their homes becoming effectively refugees in their own land we are committed to returning them home we prefer to achieve this diplomatically but let me be clear israel will do whatever it must do to restore security to our northern border and return our people safely to their homes applause last friday a third iranian proxy the houthis attacked tel aviv with a deadly drone it exploded a few hundred feet from the american consulate killing one person and injuring nine on saturday i authorized a swift response to that attack all our enemies should know this those who attack israel will pay a very heavy price applause and as we defend ourselves on all fronts i know that america has our back and i thank you for it all sides of the aisle thank you applause my friends for decades america has provided israel with generous military assistance and a grateful israel has provided america with critical intelligence that saved many lives weve jointly developed some of the most sophisticated weapons on earth i choose my words carefully weve jointly developed some of the most sophisticated weapons on earth that help protect both our countries and we also help keep americans boots off the ground while protecting our shared interests in the middle east applause i deeply appreciate americas support including in this current war but this is an exceptional moment fast tracking us military aid can dramatically expedite an end to the war in gaza and help prevent a broader war in the middle east in world war two as britain fought on the front lines of civilization winston churchill appealed to americans with these famous words give us the tools and well finish the job today as israel fights on the front line of civilization i to appeal to america give us the tools faster and well finish the job faster applause my dear friends the war in gaza could end tomorrow if hamas surrenders disarms and returns all the hostages applause but if they dont israel will fight until we destroy hamas military capabilities end its rule in gaza and bring all our hostages home applause thats what total victory means and we will settle for nothing less the day after we defeat hamas a new gaza can emerge my vision for that day is of a de militarized and de radicalized gaza israel does not seek to resettle gaza but for the foreseeable future we must retain overriding security control there to prevent the resurgence of terror to ensure that gaza never again poses a threat to israel applause gaza should have a civilian administration run by palestinians who do not seek to destroy israel thats not too much to ask its a fundamental thing that we have a right to demand and to receive applause a new generation of palestinians must no longer be taught to hate jews but rather to live in peace with us applause those twin words de militarization and deradicalization those two concepts were applied to germany and japan after world war two and that led to decades of peace prosperity and security following our victory with the help of regional partners the demilitarization and deradicalization of gaza can also lead to a future of security prosperity and peace thats my vision for gaza applause now heres my vision for the broader middle east its also shaped in part by what we saw in the aftermath of world war ii after that war america forges security alliance in europe to counter the growing soviet threats likewise america and israel today can forge a security alliance in the middle east to counter the growing iranian threat all countries that are at peace with israel and all those countries who will make peace with israel should be invited to join this alliance we saw a glimpse of that potential alliance on april 14th led by the united states more than half a dozen nations worked alongside israel to help neutralize hundreds of missiles and drones launched by iran against us thank you president biden for bringing that coalition together the new alliance i envision would be a natural extension of the ground breaking abraham accords those accords saw peace forged between israel and four arab countries and they were supported by republicans and democrats alike i have a name for this new alliance i think we should call it the abraham alliance i want to thank president trump for his leadership in brokering the stark abraham accords like americans israelis were relieved that president trump emerged safe and sound from that dastardly attack on him dastardly attack on american democracy there is no room for political violence in democracies i also want to thank president trump for all the things he did for israel from recognizing israels sovereignty over the golan heights to confronting irans aggression to recognizing jerusalem as our capital and moving the american embassy there thats jerusalem our eternal capital never to be divided again my dear friends democrats and republicans despite these times of upheaval im hopeful about the future im hopeful about israel because my people the jewish people emerged from the depths of hell from dispossession and genocide and against all odds we restored our sovereignty and our ancient homeland we built a powerful and vibrant democracy a democracy that pushes the boundaries of innovation for the betterment of all humanity im hopeful about america because im hopeful about americans i know how much the people of this country have sacrificed to defend freedom america will be continued to be a force for light and good in a dark and dangerous world for free peoples everywhere america remains the beacon of liberty its extraordinary founders envisioned back in 1776 working together im confident that our two nations will vanquish the tyrants and terrorists who threaten us both as israels prime minister i promise you this no matter how long it takes no matter how difficult the road ahead israel will not relent israel will not bend we will defend our land we will defend our people we will fight until we achieve victory over liberty rather victory of liberty over tyrany victory of life over death victory of good over evil thats our solemn commitment and we will continue to work with the united states and our arab partners to transform a troubled region from a backwater of repression poverty and war into a thriving oasis of dignity prosperity and peace in this noble mission as in many others israel will always remain americas indispensable ally through thick and thin in good times and in bad israel will always be your loyal friend and your steadfast partner on behalf of the people of israel i came here today to say thank you america thank you for your support and solidarity thank you for standing in israel with israel in our hour of need together we shall defend our common civilization together we shall secure a brilliant future for both our nations may god bless israel may god bless america and may god bless the great alliance between israel and america forever thank you gtgt the purpose of

stellantis may stop making cars in britain unless the government does more to boost demand for electric vehicles welcome to your europe markets briefing im thomas warner stellantis âs chief executive says that new regulations may force the carmaker to stop its uk production at least 22 of the new cars each manufacturer sells in the uk this year must be fully electric carmakers who fail to meet the target face heavy fines but industry data suggests that fully electric cars are only made up 161 of sales through to may maria grazia devino told an audience in london today that the carmaker will decide within one year whether to continue manufacturing in the uk or not lufthansa will introduce what it calls an environmental cost surcharge from 2025 the german flag carrier said that the charge reflects the cost of sustainable aviation fuel mandates fares will go up between eur1 and eur72 depending on the ticket lufthansa shares fell around 1 on the news it was one of many european stocks to have a tough day on tuesday the german dax and frances cac 40 came under heavy pressure major slumps from healthcare giant merck as well as airbus more than offset gains from some energy majors those energy gains meant the wider stoxx 600 and londons ftse fell less heavily germany s merck recovered some of this morning s losses but was still down in the high single digits the diversified healthcare group revealed late on monday that its halting the trial of a new cancer treatment its the latest in a string of highprofile development setbacks airbus shares meanwhile trended lower and lower as the day wore on investors reacted badly to a cut in its aircraft delivery forecast and therefore its profit the company blamed supply chain issues one analyst that we spoke to said that airbus has missed a golden opportunity
i think the other thing thats a bit disappointing with all this is the fact if we think about where boeing is right now and how itâs under a lot of regulatory scrutiny and paring back production it would have been a good opportunity really for airbus to potentially pick up some new business and you know given the supply chain issues thats looking rather unlikely

     leading securities law firm bleichmar fonti amp auld llp announces it

     investors have until august 19 2024 to ask the court to be appointed
to lead the case the complaint asserts claims under sections 10b and
20a of the securities exchange act of 1934 on behalf of investors in
uipath securities between december 1 2023 and the close of trading on may
29 2024 inclusive the class period the case is pending in the us
district court for the southern district of new york and is captioned zack
steiner v uipath inc no 124cv4702 a copy of the lawsuit can be
found httpswwwbfalawcomsitefilescasesshowtemppdf

     what is the lawsuit about

     the complaint alleges that throughout the class period defendants
made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of
uipaths turnaround strategy for instance defendants represented that the
company was executing against that strategy and were seeing the results
in the deal quality and the customer quality asserted that our strategic
investments in innovations and our gotomarket ecosystem positions us well
for continued momentum and that theres no doubt theres been better
execution since the implementation of the turnaround strategy

     these statements were allegedly materially false and misleading in
truth uipaths turnaround strategy had failed fruitless investments and
inconsistent execution plagued the companys overhauled gotomarket
strategy additionally uipaths aipowered business automation platform
caused confusion among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled
as a result uipath experienced significant difficulties closing andor
expanding large multiyear deals

     on may 29 2024 uipath announced the sudden departure of ceo robert
enslin on the same day uipath announced disappointing 1q 25 financial
results and significantly cut its fy 25 revenue guidance by 10 or 150
million the company attributed the poor results and guidance to several
factors related to its failed turnaround strategy including an inadequate
execution strategy to scale the companys aipowered growth products to
reach their full potential and that ai had createed a little bit of
confusion with our customers ui path also described how the investments we
have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations
and made us less agile in responding to customer needs while experiencing
contract execution challenges on large deals

     this news caused the price of uipath stock to decline 623 per share
or more than 34 from 1830 per share on may 29 2024 to 1207 per
share on may 30 2024 resulting in significant harm to investors

a growing number of investigations and legal complaints are targeting teslas claims that its cars are full selfdriving scrutinizing the companys decisions to brand and market its suite of driverassistance technologies for evidence of potential fraudthe us justice department is probing the companys marketing of both full selfdriving and autopilot teslas advanced driverassistance systems californias department of motor vehicles is also reviewing those features in light of provisions including a 2022 law prohibiting companies from using marketing and language that would lead a reasonable person to believe that the feature allows the vehicle to function as an autonomous vehicle tesla has received inquiries from the securities and exchange commission related to its claims to investors according to news reports and public filings and a civil lawsuit in california represents drivers who say they were defrauded by the companys claims and are seeking refunds and damages over their purchasesat issue is whether the term full selfdriving implies that the cars are autonomous — meaning drivers dont need to pay attention in recent court filings tesla says that the cars are not autonomous and that its user manuals and sensors alert drivers to the need to hold the wheel and keep their eyes on the road yet in a post on x last month teslas head of autopilot ashok elluswamy used the word writing that the cars have the most autonomous capability compared to any production cartesla ceo elon musk and elluswamy did not respond to requests for comment the justice department and the securities and exchange commission through spokespeople declined to commentthe wave of scrutiny comes less than a month before tesla is due to unveil what it calls a robotaxi a dedicated vehicle that would run a version of its full selfdriving software shuttling passengers between destinations without a driver it has no known production timeline and tesla is known for making ambitious product announcements without concrete delivery plansmany of the probes and lawsuits weigh similar claims made by muskmost tesla cars today come with a feature it calls autopilot a suite of software that allows vehicles to keep their distance behind others maintain a set speed and steer on highways following the trajectory of lane lines the company has for years offered an upgrade package called full selfdriving which costs 8000 down from 15000 — or 99 a month — and enables its vehicles to navigate city and residential streets on their own provided the driver demonstrates they are paying attentiontesla promised customers years ago that this upgrade would turn cars into an appreciable asset — meaning their value would increase over time — after they one day become autonomous through a software update that has yet to happen and thats what the california lawsuit is aboutcontrary to teslas repeated promises that it would have a fully selfdriving car within months or a year tesla has never been remotely close to achieving that goal reads the civil complaint in us district court for the northern district of california which is seeking classaction certification in addition to financial remedies it asks for an injunction prohibiting tesla from continuing to market its technology in deceptive and misleading waysone of the arguments we make is you cant get more selfdriving than fully selfdriving said attorney andrew kirtley who is representing customers in the autopilot classaction suitamong the statements under scrutiny according to interviews and documents musks 2019 pronouncement that tesla would put 1 million robotaxis on the road by 2020 and teslas assertions that its vehicles have all the hardware needed to deploy the full selfdriving feature the northern california civil lawsuit specifically cites musks assertion on a 2016 conference call that a tesla would be able to drive itself from los angeles to new york by the end of next year without the need for a single touchin that case drivers allege that they were misled into paying for a feature that still hasnt materialized meanwhile at least two dozen people have died in crashes in which teslas driverassistance features were engaged according to the national highway traffic safety administration in some cases they were alleged to be driving under the influence or distractedin teslas response to the california lawsuit the company claims its driverassistance features — including steering accelerating and merging — make the cars selfdriving but not autonomous it has made the same claim on its website saying that autopilot and full selfdriving features do not make the vehicle autonomous and that its systems are intended to be used only with a fully attentive driverbut legal experts question the distinction when i hear selfdriving and autonomous i kind of hear the same thing said anthony casey a university of chicago law professor adding that the legal question will revolve around what would a normal person hear in the term selfdrivingstill he said the bar for proving that teslas marketing claims amount to fraud particularly criminal fraud is high you also would have to show that they intended to get a person to buy it by misleading you casey saidtesla is far from the first company to tussle with regulators and federal officials over the ambitious promises of its tech legal experts said other companies in similar situations have made the same argument tesla is making that failure to deliver on its promises is not a crimean attorney for elizabeth holmes the disgraced silicon valley wunderkind who promoted a medical device that could purportedly perform a battery tests with a tiny amount of blood made this argument explicitly during holmess 2021 criminal trial failure is not a crime the attorney argued trying your hardest and coming up short is not a crime a jury disagreed holmes was convicted and is serving an 11year prison sentencein the ongoing justice department probe investigators have focused on teslas promises according to john bernal a former tesla autopilot employee who was interviewed by an fbi agent and a representative of the us transportation department for five hours in 2022they kept saying over and over again their focus is in terms of marketing with the namesake bernal said referring to terms such as autopilot and full selfdriving they believe that those namesakes imply a higher sense of functionality than they actually deliverbernal said their main holy grail info they were seeking was they wanted physical written documentation in advertisement or marketing form that tesla was billing its driverassistance systems as autonomous bernal did not have evidence of that he said he said the officials told him their investigation had stretched back to 2018 and involved interviews with numerous employeesfederal officials have focused at least in part on a 2016 tesla marketing video set to the rolling stones song paint it black that purported to show a tesla maneuvering near the companys headquarters on its own which came up repeatedly in the interview with bernal the person in the drivers seat is only there for legal reasons the 2016 videos opening slide reads he is not doing anything the car is driving itselfa tesla official later acknowledged after reporting by the new york times that the video was staged and the car in fact crashed during filmingat the time musk was deep into a push to make teslas capable of autonomy an effort that led to heated backandforths between him and the engineers responsible for delivering at one point musk left a car during a test drive after the software performed badly slamming the door shut and walking back toward teslas officesnothing fing works musk fumed before storming off according to a person with knowledge of the episode speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of retributiona recent musk biography said musk frequently would show up to teslas office dismayed by the softwares performancea few months after the incident newly detailed by the washington post tesla released the paint it black videotesla in response to another lawsuit called the video an aspirational demonstration of its softwares potential capabilitiessimilar videos have been used in other cases — even against another electric vehicle manufacturer trevor milton the founder of electric truck startup nikola was found guilty of misleading investors in a federal fraud case that alleged a video demonstration of its trucks capabilities in reality showed the truck rolling downhill rather than propelling itself on its owncarl tobias a university of richmond law professor said the civil case would be most likely to gain momentum in the short term given the extended nature of federal investigations and the lower burden of proof in civil casesthere were some representations especially video that they made … look better than it actually was he said and i think people felt manipulated in that context that they overrated how quickly they could do things or how well it could perform and that kind of thing as a sales techniquetobias said customers reliance on those claims could entitle them to refundsmusk had been pushing for autonomous capability in his cars for years in ways that were at times inconsistent with teslas level of progress and to the chagrin of safety officials who had not anticipated such a brazen effort to bill consumer vehicles as selfdriving the post has reportedaround late 2014 software entrepreneur dan odowd said hed learned musk was planning to deliver an autonomous vehicle by the end of the following year now a vocal tesla critic odowd was at the time a contractor for tesla whose company helped streamline the autopilot technology to take up less computer spacein 2019 musk made another audacious promise to put 1 million robotaxis on the road by 2020 in part by utilizing the privately owned teslas sitting in peoples driveways the fleet wakes up with an overtheair update musk said at the timethat didnt happen instead tesla has focused on smaller developments releasing the first iteration of its full selfdriving software known as full selfdriving beta in late 2020 followed by successive improvements such as better recognition of road signs and lane markings and aiming for smoother driving musk launched the latest version of the software known as v12 this year touting it as a revolutionary leap forwardin april musk made a new promise tesla robotaxi unveil on 88 he wrote on thursday however bloomberg news reported that tesla planned to delay the event to octobertom gorman former senior counsel in the secs division of enforcement said musks robotaxi statements could also be reviewed by the agency which would scrutinize the promises in light of investor decisions musks robotaxi promise was made amid slumping stock prices in the first half of 2024if he really doesnt have the ability to do what hes doing … theyd go after him for that gorman said if youre saying i am going to have a completely selfdriving car and it can drive you around the planet completely by yourself two weeks from now and youre starting to hype that hell probably get suedcopyright c 2024 the washington post,2024-07-16,Tesla,esg
california will have to build public charging stations at an unprecedented — and some experts say unrealistic — pace to meet the needs of the 7 million electric cars expected on its roads in less than seven yearsthe sheer scale of the buildout has alarmed many experts and lawmakers who fear that the state wont be prepared as californians purchase more electric carsa million public chargers are needed in california by the end of 2030 according to the states projections — almost 10 times more than the number available to drivers in december to meet that target 129000 new stations — more than seven times the current pace — must be built every year for the next seven years then the pace would have to accelerate again to reach a target of 21 million chargers in 2035a robust network of public chargers — akin to the states more than 8000 gas stations — is essential to ensure that drivers will have the confidence to purchase electric vehicles over the next several yearsit is very unlikely that we will hit our goals and to be completely frank the ev goals are a noble aspiration but unrealistic said stanford professor bruce cain who coauthored a policy briefing detailing californias electric vehicle charging problems this is a wakeup call that we address potential institutional and policy obstacles more seriously before we commit blindlyunder californias landmark electric car mandate  a pillar of gov gavin newsoms climate change agenda  68 of all new 2030 model cars sold in the state must be zero emissions increasing to 100 for 2035 when 15 million electric cars are expected in californiawere going to look really silly if we are telling people that they can only buy electric vehicles and we dont have the charging infrastructure to support that said assemblymember jesse gabriel a democrat from encino who introduced a package of unsuccessful bills last year aimed at expanding access to car chargerswe are way behind where we need to be gabriel told calmattersbig obstacles stand in the way of amping up the pace of new charging stations in public places california will need billions of dollars in state federal and private investments streamlined city and county permitting processes major power grid upgrades and accelerated efforts by utilities to connect chargers to the gridstate officials also are tasked with ensuring that charging stations are available statewide in rural and lessaffluent areas where private companies are reluctant to invest and that they are reliable and functioning whenever drivers pull upin pacific gas amp electrics vast service area home to 40 of all californians electric car purchases are moving twice as fast as the buildout of charging stations said lydia krefta the utilitys director of clean energy transportation californians now own more than 15 million batterypowered carspatty monahan whos on the energy commission the state agency responsible for funding and guiding the rampup told calmatters that she is confident that california can build the chargers its residents need in timethe agencys estimate of the current chargers is likely an undercount she said in addition fastcharging stations could play a bigger role than initially projected meaning hundreds of thousands of fewer chargers might be needed also as the ranges and charging speeds on cars improve there may be less demand for public chargerscalifornia has a history of defying the odds monahan said we have a history of advancing clean cars clean energy writlarge we have naysayers left and right saying you cant do it and then we do itbarriers to private investments an uncertain marketon a september day last year monahan spoke behind a podium in the parking lot of a bay area grocery store a row of newly constructed car chargers rose behind herlets celebrate for a moment she saidcalifornia had met its goal of 10000 fast electric chargers statewide — two years ahead of a target set in 2018fast chargers like the new ones at the grocery store are increasingly seen as critical to meeting the needs of drivers they can power a car to 80 in 20 minutes to an hour while the typical charger in use today a slower level 2 takes from four to 10 hoursbut installing and operating fast chargers is an expensive business — one that doesnt easily turn a profitnationwide each fast charger can cost up to 117000 according to a 2023 study and in california it could be even more — between 122000 and 440000 each according to a separate study  although the energy commission said the range was 110000 to 125000 for one of its programs most of americas publicly traded charger companies have been forced to seek more financing lay off workers and slow their network build outs analysts said evgo  for instance has seen its share price crater as has chargepoint  which specializes in selling the slower level 2 hardwarecalifornia stands apart from other states — it has by far the most chargers and electric car sales and more incentives and policies encouraging themtesla americas topselling electric car manufacturer dominates fastcharging in both california and the us — but the company didnt get into the business to sell charges to drivers it got into the charger business to sell its electric cars initially tesla superchargers were exclusive to its drivers but starting this year other ev drivers can use them after tesla provided ports to ford and other automakersteslas manufacturing prowess supply chain dominance and decadeplus of experience with fast chargers have given it an edge over competitors — a coterie of unprofitable publicly traded startups as well as private companies that often benefit from public subsidies according to analystsall the automakers joined forces with their biggest competitor said loren mcdonald chief executive of the consulting firm evadoption if that doesnt tell you how bad fastcharging networks and infrastructure were i dont know what else doesnow tesla is showing uncertainty about the future of its charging business amid slumping car sales and eliminated nearly its entire 500member supercharger team in april then chief executive elon musk said in may that he would spend 500 million to expand the network and hired back some fired workersin california electrify america a privately held company was created by volkswagen as a settlement for cheating on emissions tests for its gaspowered cars the company is spending 800 million on california chargers building a robust network of 260 stations with more than half in lowincome communities including the states worst charging desert  imperial countythe problem is electrify america was ranked dead last in a consumer survey last year and its chargers have been plagued by reliability problems and customer complaints the california air resources board in january directed electrify america to strive to achieve charger reliability consistent with the state of the industry a company spokesperson said the dissatisfaction showed an industry in its growth trajectory there are signs of improvement based on consumer data from the first three months of this yearstartups continue to jump into the charging business with the number of companies offering fast chargers growing from 14 in 2020 to 41 in 2024 evadoption said seven carmakers formed a 1 billion venture to build a 30000charger network in north america and gas stations such as circle k are offering more charging because electric car customers spend more time shopping while waiting for their rides to juice upbut the realization that charging is a costly business has set in on wall street and that doesnt seem likely to change anytime soon can public ev fastcharging stations be profitable in the united states the consultancy mckinsey amp company asked the fervor the excitement from the investor base has definitely dwindled quite a bit given the prospects that ev adoption in the us is going to be slower revenue growth is really slower the path to profitability is going to be slower and they might need more capital than everyone originally expected said christopher dendrinos a financial analyst who covers electric car charging companies for the investment bank rbc capital marketsthe stakes are high for california when it comes to encouraging investments in expensive fast chargers if 63000 additional ones were built california might need 402000 fewer slower level 2 chargers in 2030 according to an alternative forecast by the energy commissionbillions of public dollars will it be enoughnationwide 53 billion to 127 billion in private investments and public funding is needed by 2030 to build chargers for about 33 million electric cars according to a federal estimate  of that about half would be for public chargerscongress and the biden administration have set aside 5 billion for a national network of fast chargers so far only 33 in eight locations have been built but more than 14000 others are in the works according to the federal highway administration californias share of the federal money totals 384 million about 500 fast chargers will be built with an initial 405 million said energy commission spokesperson lindsay buckleyin addition the state has spent 584 million to build more than 33000 electric car chargers through its clean transportation program funded by fees drivers pay when they register cars the legislature extended that program for an additional decade last yearnewsom has committed to spending 1 billion through 2028 on chargers with his  california climate commitment  buckley said but this year newsom and the legislature trimmed 167 million from the charger budget as the state faces a record deficit a lobbyist for the electric vehicle charging association said the state pullback sends a very challenging message to the industrycalifornias commitment to charger funding is solid despite the cuts buckley said they have not yet estimated the total investment needed in california to meet the targetsbut ted lamm a uc berkeley law researcher who studies electric car infrastructure said the magnitude of building what california needs in coming years likely dwarfs the public funding availablestate and federal programs will only fund a fraction and the state needs to spend that money on lowerincome communities he saidanother possible funding source is californias low carbon fuel standard which is expected to be revised in november  the program requires carbonintensive fuel companies to pay for cleanerburning transportation utilities get credits and use that money to pay for chargers rebates to car buyers and grid improvements said laura renger executive director of the california electric transportation coalition which represents utilitiesi think with that we would have enough money renger said she said the programs overhaul could help utilities invest billions in chargers and other electric car programs over the next two decadesbacklogged local permits and grid delaysone of the biggest barriers to more chargers isnt money its that cities and counties are slow to approve plans for the vast number of stations neededstate officials only have so much political power to compel local jurisdictions to do what they want — a reality made abundantly clear by the housing crisis  for instance california relies on grants and persuasion to accomplish its goals and the slow buildout of chargers shows how those strategies can fall short said stanfords cainthe locals cannot be compelled by regulatory agencies to make land and resources available for what the state wants to achieve cain saidthe same obstacles have marked the states broader effort to electrify california and switch to clean energy local opposition and environmental reviews sometimes hold up large solar projects and transmission projects for yearscalifornia has created a culture of regulation that emphasizes the need to be extra careful and extra perfect but this takes an incredible amount of time steve bohlen senior director of government affairs at lawrence livermore national laboratory said last month at the inaugural hearing of the state assemblys select committee on permitting reform were moving into a period of rapid change and so perfect cant be the enemy of the goodchargers arent as complicated as largescale solar or offshore wind projects  but most chargers installed in public spaces do need a landuse or encroachment permit among other approvals california has passed laws requiring local jurisdictions to streamline permits for chargers whats more the governors office of business development now grades cities and counties using a scorecard and maintains a map displaying who has or hasnt made life easier for car charger builders but these strategies only go so farit doesnt matter how many requirements you put on local governments lamm said if they just dont have the time in the day to do it  its going to sit in the backlog because thats how it worksthe delays have consequences getting a station permitted in california on average takes 26 longer than the national average electrify america reported designing and constructing a station in california can cost on average 37 more than in other states because of delays in permitting and grid connections a utility on average takes 17 weeks after work is completed to connect chargers to the grid electric america saidpowering large charging projects often requires grid upgrades which can take a year or more for approval said chanel parson a director at southern california edison supply chain issues also make getting the right equipment a challengeedison which has a 10year plan to meet expected demand has asked the utilities commission for approval to upgrade the grid where it anticipates high

customer service is horriblefor years the reliability of charging networks has been a welldocumented problem only 73 of fast chargers in the san francisco bay area were functional in a 2022 study the growth of the ev market has put increasing strain on public charging stations a consumer survey found in january  the california air resources board approved a final 200 million spending plan for

companys customer service line after finding a broken charger at a station along interstate5it didnt work randolph said during the board meeting called the customer service line waited like 10ish minutes the charger was showing operable on the app and the guy goes oh my data is showing me that it has not had a successful charge in three daysthese issues are not easy barrosa responded our head is not in the sand he told board members earlier we are listening to customersbut randolph addressing journalists at a conference in philadelphia  pushed back against the idea that because the transition to electric vehicles is happening gradually that its a failure many people will rely on charging at home or work and batteries are becoming more efficientthe infrastructure is continuing to

new delhinew delhi july 7  after being dragged to court by elon musks electric vehicle giant over the use of the tesla trademark gurugrambased company tesla power india pvt ltd is confident about settling the trademark infringement dispute with the american giant through mediationkavinder khurana managing director of tesla power in an interaction with mint stated that his company is confident it can mediate with tesla inc if mediation fails they are prepared to fight the legal battle with the american ev giant and are confident they will not lose the tesla trademarkwe are confident that we will be able to mediate and settle the matter through mediation our intention is to resolve the matter which is why we voluntarily surrendered in court on the first day and gave an undertaking that we will not engage in the ev business with the tesla trademark he saidregarding the possibility of failed mediation and concerns about losing the trademark khurana stated that they trust the court not to take away the tesla trademark from them he emphasized they are not afraid to fight this battle against teslawe believe that the courts in india are fair in their decisions if somehow an honorable court decides that we cannot use it we will respect that decision we have a business in india and we will explore remedies to address that situation but right now we are confident that the honourable court will not instruct us to stop using this brand name or trademark because it is our identity he saidi have obtained all the necessary approvals and paid over rs60 crore in taxes to the indian government including goods and services tax gst we have fulfilled all our tax obligations why should i be scared khurana saidaccording to khurana the legal suit has not impacted the business of the company and they remain profitablehowever khurana insists that tesla should directly participate in the mediation process without relying on third parties like law firms he expresses concern that if third parties involved in the mediation lack the intent to mediate and settle it could complicate reaching a resolution therefore tesla power plans to request tesla inc to send its own representative to the mediation proceedings khurana notes that tesla inc has not directly contacted them so farkhurana further expressed skepticism that only their company is targeted by tesla when there are numerous companies registered in india with the tesla trademark he pointed out that tesla inc was aware of other companies using tesla without objection when they applied for their trademark in indiawhen tesla inc applied for their trademark in india they were aware that other companies including ours were already using tesla without objection it seems theyve chosen this moment just as were on the verge of becoming profitable until now weve been incurring losses to grow our business legally under the tesla name its puzzling why theyve singled us out now he addedwhen asked about why he chose to name his company tesla khurana explained that the word tesla originates from the surname of the renowned scientist nikola tesla not invented by tesla inc or elon musk he mentioned that musk chose this name as a tribute to nikola tesla khurana pointed out that there are numerous companies worldwide using the name including 300 in the us 700 globally and 14 in indiawe obtained approval for tesla power usa llc from the government of delaware usa and similarly established tesla power usa mena llc in dubai uae in india we received approval for tesla power india pvt ltd from the ministry of

i think were getting greater confidence that inflation is moving towards that 2 target however the concern now flips to the labor market side and if we get additional softening there and the unemployment rate starts to move higher the fed might have to refocus and move a little bit more towards the job side of the market which probably gives them more cover to actually cut rates between now and the end of the year so that labor mandates really i think shifting the focus for the fed going forward

san francisco  tesla filed a response thursday disputing a wrongfuldeath lawsuit from the wife of a tesla employee killed in a fiery 2022 crash the initial suit seeking damages from tesla was filed last month in the us district court in colorado and alleges that the company sold the employee a defective car and exaggerated the capabilities of its assisted driving featuresteslas response submitted thursday states that the company disputes that it is liable for any damages whatsoever and requests that the case be moved from state to federal courta washington post investigation in february highlighted evidence that hans von ohain a tesla recruiter was using his tesla model 3s socalled full selfdriving feature when it barreled into a tree in evergreen co and exploded in flames that potentially makes him the first documented fatality linked to the most advanced driver assistance technology offered by the company after tesla initially declined to comment on the posts reporting ceo elon musk later wrote in a post on x that von ohain did not have the full selfdriving feature downloaded onto his car without providing evidence for that claimtesla and musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment thursdaythe suit filed by nora bass von ohains wife in may is the latest legal challenge to tesla alleging that a fatal or serious crash occurred while a driver was relying on technology musk has made central to the automakers brand full selfdriving and another assisted driving feature autopilot control steering and other actions typically left to the human behind the wheelmusk has said he will unveil a fully autonomous taxi called the cybercab in august but has provided few details meanwhile tesla is fighting at least eight other lawsuits  in addition to the colorado case  that allege flaws in its assistive driving technology and are headed to trial in the next year the colorado crash is also one of hundreds involving tesla vehicles investigated by federal or state officials for the role the companys assistive driving technology may have played in a collisionon thursday tesla filed a motion to move the case from the district court of the state of colorado to federal court the company argued that the case qualified for federal court because the two sides are from different states and bass is seeking damages above 75000 attorneys for bass declined to disclose the total amount they were seekingwe stay committed to advocating fiercely for the von ohain family ensuring they receive the justice they deserve said jonathan michaels basss attorney in a statement the suit refers to the crashed vehicles driver assist features only as autopilot but michaels says it was intended as a catchall to refer to all the cars automation technology including full selfdrivingin previous cases filed against tesla the company has said it is not liable for the crashes or deaths because the driver is ultimately in control of the vehicle but that contention is coming under increased scrutiny from the spate of lawsuits and federal regulators in april the national highway traffic safety administration said the name autopilot may lead drivers to believe that the automation has greater capabilities than it does the agencys comments came as it opened another probe into the technology after concerns that a sweeping december recall did not go far enough to address driver inattentioncritics say that teslas marketing and lofty promises made by musk naming the assisted driving features full selfdriving and autopilot give drivers a false sense of confidence about taking their eyes off the road or getting behind the wheel after drinking in the suit filed by bass her lawyers argue that if the technology operated properly the vehicle would not have veered off the road collided with a tree burst into flames and hans von ohains gruesome and painful death would have been avoidedmichaels the attorney said the car was also defective because of the intensity of the fire that ensued after von ohain hit the tree which ultimately caused his death colorado state patrol sgt robert madden who oversaw the agencys investigation into the crash told the post in an interview that it was one of the most intense vehicle fires he had ever seen and that von ohain likely would have survived the impact of the crash alonethe suit does not mention that von ohain was drinking in the hours leading up to the crash and died with a blood alcohol level of more than three times the legal limit in colorado according to an autopsy conducted by the clear creek county coroners office the surviving passenger erik rossiter who registered a similar blood alcohol level after the crash said von ohain seemed composed and by no means intoxicated as they got in the tesla and headed home from a day at the golf course michaels said he plans to challenge the validity of von ohains toxicology reading in courtbecause of the intensity of the fire state investigators were unable to access data from the car tesla told colorado state police that it could not confirm whether a driverassistance system had been in use because it did not receive data overtheair for this incident according to the state investigative reportbass said in interviews that von ohain received the full selfdriving feature with his employee discount and used it nearly every time he got behind the wheel she said its driving could be jerky and unreliable but that her husband considered musk a brilliant man and was passionate about training futuristic technology so that it could one day revolutionize the way society gets around we knew the technology had to learn and we were willing to be part of that she saidtesla owners have long complained of occasionally erratic behavior by the cars software including sudden braking and missed road markings rossiter the passenger told investigators and the post that the car struggled to navigate the mountain curves on their way to the golf course the morning of the crash forcing von ohain repeatedly to yank it back on coursebefore representing bass michaels brought one of the first major autopilot cases in front of a jury last year in riverside calif but tesla ultimately prevailedin recent months tesla has shown a fresh willingness to settle some legal cases alleging failings in its assisted driving technology despite musks vow on twitter in 2022 to never settle an unjust case against us even if we will probably lose just this year the company has settled at least two wrongful death lawsuitscopyright c 2024

that potentially makes him the first documented fatality linked to the most advanced driver assistance technology offered by the company after tesla initially declined to comment on the posts reporting ceo elon musk later wrote in a post on x that von ohain did not have the full selfdriving feature downloaded onto his car without providing evidence for that claimtesla and musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment thursdaythe suit filed by nora bass von ohains wife in may is the latest legal challenge to tesla alleging that a fatal or serious crash occurred while a driver was relying on technology musk has made central to the automakers brand full selfdriving and another assisted driving feature autopilot control steering and other actions typically left to the human behind the wheelmusk has said he will unveil a fully autonomous taxi called the cybercab in august but has provided few details meanwhile tesla is fighting at least eight other lawsuits — in addition to the colorado case — that allege flaws in its assistive driving technology and are headed to trial in the next year the colorado crash is also one of hundreds involving tesla vehicles investigated by federal or state officials for the role the companys assistive driving technology may have played in a collisionon thursday tesla filed a motion to move the case from the district court of the state of colorado to federal court the company argued that the case qualified for federal court because the two sides are from different states and bass is seeking damages above 75000 attorneys for bass declined to disclose the total amount they were seekingwe stay committed to advocating fiercely for the von ohain family ensuring they receive the justice they deserve said jonathan michaels basss attorney in a statement the suit refers to the crashed vehicles driver assist features only as autopilot but michaels says it was intended as a catchall to refer to all the cars automation technology including full selfdrivingin previous cases filed against tesla the company has said it is not liable for the crashes or deaths because the driver is ultimately in control of the vehicle but that contention is coming under increased scrutiny from the spate of lawsuits and federal regulators in april the national highway traffic safety administration said the name autopilot may lead drivers to believe that the automation has greater capabilities than it does the agencys comments came as it opened another probe into the technology after concerns that a sweeping december recall did not go far enough to address driver inattentioncritics say that teslas marketing and lofty promises made by musk naming the assisted driving features full selfdriving and autopilot give drivers a false sense of confidence about taking their eyes off the road or getting behind the wheel after drinking in the suit filed by bass her lawyers argue that if the technology operated properly the vehicle would not have veered off the road collided with a tree burst into flames and hans von ohains gruesome and painful death would have been avoidedmichaels the attorney said the car was also defective because of the intensity of the fire that ensued after von ohain hit the tree which ultimately caused his death colorado state patrol sgt robert madden who oversaw the agencys investigation into the crash told the post in an interview that it was one of the most intense vehicle fires he had ever seen and that von ohain likely would have survived the impact of the crash alonethe suit does not mention that von ohain was drinking in the hours leading up to the crash and died with a blood alcohol level of more than three times the legal limit in colorado according to an autopsy conducted by the clear creek county coroners office the surviving passenger erik rossiter who registered a similar blood alcohol level after the crash said von ohain seemed composed and by no means intoxicated as they got in the tesla and headed home from a day at the golf course michaels said he plans to challenge the validity of von ohains toxicology reading in courtbecause of the intensity of the fire state investigators were unable to access data from the car tesla told colorado state police that it could not confirm whether a driverassistance system had been in use because it did not receive data overtheair for this incident according to the state investigative reportbass said in interviews that von ohain received the full selfdriving feature with his employee discount and used it nearly every time he got behind the wheel she said its driving could be jerky and unreliable but that her husband considered musk a brilliant man and was passionate about training futuristic technology so that it could one day revolutionize the way society gets around we knew the technology had to learn and we were willing to be part of that she saidtesla owners have long complained of occasionally erratic behavior by the cars software including sudden braking and missed road markings rossiter the passenger told investigators and the post that the car struggled to navigate the mountain curves on their way to the golf course the morning of the crash forcing von ohain repeatedly to yank it back on coursebefore representing bass michaels brought one of the first major autopilot cases in front of a jury last year in riverside calif but tesla ultimately prevailedin recent months tesla has shown a fresh willingness to settle some legal cases alleging failings in its assisted driving technology despite musks vow on twitter in 2022 to never settle an unjust case against us even if we will probably lose just this year the company has settled at least two wrongful death lawsuitscopyright c 2024

the pay package for elon musk and tesla is significant one it offers stability for a company where people were concerned investors were concerned whats going to happen because if that pay package had not been passed he very well could have left the company and that would have been disastrous for tesla and disastrous for the stock so the pay package had actually been agreed upon years prior based on metrics that elon musk had to make good on and he had made good on all of those metrics so the fact is he should have been paid that amount he jumped through all the hoops to make that happen and he did do all that work so he now should be paid on that it offers longer term stability for the company as they navigate the current environment for ev as they navigate growing competition and yet tesla is much more than a car manufacturer so i think this gives paves the way for much more creativity much more ai focus in the company so in my mind it was a good thing that it survived with the pay package and that it does offer stability for the company i think that pushback that came from institutional investors is around just ceo pay packages in general and yet i dont think you can say ceo packages in general i think each company needs to look at their own metrics and what theyre trying to accomplish and what the ceo needs to make and lets not forget that he had not been paid over a long period of time so he hadnt been receiving these huge enormous pay so part of this is back pay that he is being paid now so i think it all needs to be taken in context and well see what happens as a result of this with other companiesc copyright thomson reuters 2024 click for restrictions  httpaboutreuterscomfulllegalasp",2024-06-17,Tesla,esg

after tesla announced thursday that shareholders had voted to restore elon musks controversial 50 billion pay package solidifying his status as one of the worlds richest men the crowd at the companys annual shareholder meeting in austin erupted in cheers and the elated ceo jumped onto the stagehot damn i love you guys musk said as his fans chanted elon elonit was a decisive outcome after months of uncertainty for the electricvehicle maker before the pay package was invalidated by a delaware judge earlier this year musk had threatened to pull back from the company unless he was granted greater control and influence the vote outcome suggested strong investor confidence in musk despite the companys falling sales mass layoffs and increased regulatory scrutinyafter his victory was announced musk spent over an hour making bold claims about the future of tesla declaring that its about to embark on not just a new chapter but a new bookits actually conceivable and its within the realm of possibility for tesla to achieve a valuation 10 times that of the most valuable company today he said so when i say its like were starting a new book its going to be the best bookin a wednesday night post on his social media platform x musk said the measure passed by a wide margin details werent disclosedtesla shares jumped nearly 3 to close at 18247 thursday on the newsa delaware judge threw out the pay package worth as much as 56 billion earlier this year citing its unprecedented size and its approval by a board stocked with close musk associates as part of the deal struck in 2018 the board agreed to grant musk stock options as tesla hit certain valuation milestonesthe shareholder vote sends a strong signal that he has the broad support of tesla investors who were worried that musk would make good on his threat in january to pull back from tesla and build futuristic technology — such as robotics and artificial intelligence — outside of tesla such a future would be detrimental to the electricvehicle maker which reported a steeperthanexpected 55 percent plunge in profit for the first quarter due to weak ev salesmusks pay package will not be automatically reinstated however for musk to receive the pay package the judge would have to change her ruling or she would have to be overruled in appeals court according to natela shenon a partner at the los angelesbased firm grant shenon who specializes in complex business transactions and disputesbut the outcome of thursdays vote should give tesla the legal ammunition it needs to have the court officially reinstate it she saidthe whole premise of the judges ruling was that she felt the tesla board was under elon musks control and was not representing the best interests of the shareholders shenon said this is clear evidence that the shareholders are in support of the pay packagein the months leading up to the vote investors large and small were split on whether to support the package while some major shareholders criticized musk as a distracted leader who doesnt deserve such a reward others lauded him for being a generational geniusour answer is clear loud and unequivocal tesla is better with elon tesla is elon ron baron a billionaire and investor in tesla said before thursdays votelate wednesday investors and musk supporters including x ceo linda yaccarino applauded the results musk would have remained among the worlds richest people regardless of whether he kept the pay package but he clearly found the victory sweet in a post wednesday night he pledged to make tesla the most valuable company on earthbrad lander the new york city comptroller whose office owns about 34 million shares of tesla and invests on behalf of public employees said he voted against the package because of teslas struggles and musks insistence on dividing his attention among multiple companies musks wednesday night tweet announcing the outcome lander said was more evidence of the failure of corporate governance at teslathis is not how the votes are supposed to be counted and made public lander said if this unprecedented pay package is approved as longterm investors in tesla we expect a ceo who is deeply committed to the companys growth rather than other business venturesross gerber a longtime investor in tesla and a vocal critic of musk said the results of the vote are great for musk but do not address the companys current woesif they put as much effort into selling cars … that would help he saidmusk and a tesla spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment late wednesdaywhile

video transcript
the us economy shows more signs of cooling welcome to trading at noon im thomas warner mays us producer price index came in below forecast today the ppi for final demand dropped 02 last month after advancing by an unrevised 05 in april the number of americans filing new unemployment claims meanwhile surprised to the upside new claimant numbers jumped to 10month highs of 242000 economists polled by reuters had forecast 225000 todays new numbers combined with yesterdays soft cpi reading to suggest that the economy is now cooling off and that makes quicker interest rate cuts more likely despite the feds own forecasts yesterday predicting only 25 basis points worth of cuts this year
things are setting up pretty nicely for them to go at least once this year i suspect they will probably have a cause to go twice because as i say even though they will be conservative they will want to see two or three more of these inflation reports come in quite benign and we have seen the rise in the unemployment rate in the last nonfarm payroll report for our company at least you have seen some softness in some other labor market indicators and so under the mandates of their dual framework looking at both employment and inflation i suspect they will have enough evidence to get going say by the november meeting
treasury yields have slipped in response the 10year is down to its lowest since april at around 427 the yield on the 30year bond fell 06 basis points to 444 the us treasury department will sell 22 billion in 30year bonds on thursday in its final auction of the week the tale of two markets so far today booming tech sector lifted the nasdaq to a new record open the dow jones meanwhile is down more than 05 its energy stocks have taken the biggest hit so far today the wider sampp is virtually flat broadcom is the nasdaqs biggest gainer today up more than 13 the chipmaker raised its fullyear revenue forecasts citing keen demand for airelated hardware it also plans to follow nvidia with its own 10for1 stock split broadcom shares are up 76 in the last 12 months tesla shares are up 6 ahead of todays shareholder meeting investors will vote on ceo elon musks 56 billion pay package as well as a corporate move to texas musk has already said he believes he has the votes on both counts the result will be announced at 530am eastern time boeing shares are down after reuters revealed that the planemaker is investigating another quality problem sources say that hundreds of fasteners have been incorrectly installed on the fuselages of some undelivered 787 dreamliners americas largest oil trade group today filed a federal lawsuit against new measures to reduce emissions the environmental protection agency issued rules in march that will force carmakers to produce more electric vehicles the american petroleum institute which includes exxonmobil and chevron say that the epa has exceeded its congressional authority and that is trading at noonc copyright thomson reuters 2024 click for restrictions  httpaboutreuterscomfulllegalasp",2024-06-13,Tesla,environment

jul 29 2024chicago il – july 29 2024 – today zacks investment ideas feature highlights alphabet googl and tesla tslaalphabetreported earnings tuesday and beat analysts’ estimates on both the top and bottom line yet the stock is rolling over is it time to get out of the stock i think not and rather it would be a fantastic buying opportunityfor immediate release time to buy the dip on alphabet following earnings there are two primary reasons for alphabets selloff following its recent earnings report both of which i believe are temporary first the overall market weakness is weighing on the stock second there are concerns about whether the significant capital expenditures on ai infrastructure will generate sufficient nearterm profitswhile the concerns are reasonable alphabet is such a sturdy asset that i believe you can overlook any nearterm concerns as the longterm still looks so fruitful for the companybut what is especially compelling is that googl is trading at a relatively discounted valuation while business fundamentals are strong and the company enters exciting new technological venturesfor investors who are keen on buying leading technology stocks at a discount alphabet may be the next addition to your portfolioearnings beat but the alphabet stock fallsalphabet has reported a solid second quarter for 2024 showcasing strong performance across its key segments and continued innovation in artificial intelligence the companys results underline its robust financial health and strategic investments in ai and cloud infrastructurealphabet delivered revenues of 85 billion marking a 14 yearonyear increase this growth was driven by strong performance in search and cloud services the cloud segment achieved quarterly revenues exceeding 10 billion for the first time alongside a notable 1 billion in operating profitsearch revenues reached 485 billion growing 138 yearoveryear while cloud revenues saw a slight acceleration growing 288 to 104 billion ai is playing a pivotal role here with the majority of alphabets top 100 customers utilizing aidriven servicesadditionally seeing a reacceleration of the core search business is a fantastic development as many investors had begun to doubt itfurthermore notes about the development at waymo are very encouraging and have the potential to open another massive business opportunity for alphabethuge potential in autonomous drivingalphabet announced that they would be committing another 5 billion to expansion at waymo and i think investors are still underestimating the incredible potential herewaymo has made significant strides delivering over 50000 paid rides per week across san francisco and phoenix but most importantly waymo has focused on optimizing its service for profitability and scalability making strategic decisions that enhance its configurability across various vehicle types and conditionsthis is a very different approach thanteslais taking as alphabet believes providing the underlying technology will be a superior business model and is similar to the way googl influences the mobile computing industry with android they make no devices but are the most widely used mobile software in the worldwaymo is also taking a bottom’s up approach developing its own sensors to control the whole tech stack alternatively tesla relies solely on camerabased vision and must manage all the additional logistics of producing a full vehicle the longer it takes tesla to get full selfdriving to actually work the more i am favoring waymo in leading the industryalphabet stock trading at a discountas noted alphabet is trading at a valuation that i consider to be appealing for longterm investors today googl is trading at 22x forward earnings which is below its 10year median of 261x and below the market averagebecause i believe alphabet is among the best companies in the world i think it unreasonable that it trades in line with the average of the index with continued strong performance across business segments and some incredible growth catalysts i think alphabet is compelling at current levelsfinal thoughtsdespite alphabets recent postearnings dip this may be an opportune moment for investors to buy the stockalphabets secondquarter earnings report showed strong performance across key segments with impressive growth in search and cloud services the company continues to lead in aidriven innovations reinforcing its competitive edge additionally the significant investment in waymo highlights alphabets potential in the autonomous driving market offering another promising growth avenueat its current valuation alphabet presents an attractive opportunity for longterm investors for investors seeking to capitalize on a leading technology stock at a discount alphabet is a compelling choicewhy haven’t you looked at zacks top stockssince 2000 our top stockpicking strategies have blown away the sampps 70 average gain per year amazingly they soared

jul 29 2024chicago il – july 29 2024 – zackscom releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises this week’s list includes tesla tsla alphabet googl apple aapl meta meta and microsoft msftmarket participants showed their disappointment with last tuesdays results from two of ‘the magnificent 7’ stocks google parentalphabetandteslafor immediate releasebreaking down magnificent 7 earningsthe worrisome aspect of the market reaction to these two reports particularly to the alphabet release is that this could be a precursor of what to expect this week from four other members of the group –microsofton tuesday july 30th after the market’s close amcmeta platformson wednesday amc july 31standappleon thursday amc august 1stit is hard to say anything positive about the tesla report but the alphabet report had a lot of positives unlike tesla which missed consensus estimates on the back to continued margin pressures alphabet beat estimates and had a number of other positives in its results including search and cloudinvestors instead zeroed in on the biggerthanexpected capital expenditure figure which fed into creeping worries about everrising aicentric capex without a timeline for when the spending will start to pay off alphabet management’s comment on the capex question that underinvesting represented a bigger risk than the alternative likely added to the market’s worries a bigger jump in search growth that could be attributed to the company’s ai investments would have eased some of those worries but that was not the casethe capex will likely be front and center in this week’s meta and microsoft reports as well concerning amazon a leader in the cloud space through its amazon web services business there are questions about the business’ decelerating growth trend in recent quarters when microsoft and alphabet are showing accelerating growth trendsapple has started making some ai announcements lately but many in the market appear skeptical of its efforts the more significant nearterm apple questions are about the evolving iphone trends in chinareturning to the alphabet and tesla results alphabet’s earnings were up 286 from the same period last year on 15 higher revenues tesla’s q2 earnings were down 453 on 23 higher revenuesthe group is expected to bring in 268 more earnings relative to the same period last year on 137 higher revenuesbeyond these mag 7 players total q2 earnings for the technology sector as a whole are expected to be up 168 from the same period last year on 95 higher revenuesthe tech sector has enjoyed a favorable revisions trend for the last few quarters with the mag 7 stocks leading the rising estimates trendearnings season scorecard and this week’s earnings reportsthrough all the results that came out on friday july 26th we have seen q2 results from 207 sampp 500 members or 414 of the index’s membership total earnings for these 207 index members are up 06 from the same period last year on 49 higher revenues with 797 beating eps estimates and only 575 able to beat revenue estimatesthe q2 reporting cycle really ramps up this week with more than 1000 companies on deck to report

asian stocks took a hit thursday amid jitters over the outlook for big tech japan was worst hit with the nikkei index down around 25 in morning trade chipmaker renesas plunged as much as 16 with hitachi among other big decliners the rest of the region wasnât spared with benchmark indexes in south korea and hong kong both off 15 or more it all followed big falls on wall street earlier the nasdaq index shed almost 4 after lackluster earnings from alphabet and tesla that marked its worst oneday fall since 2022 prime capital strategist will mcgough says us politics is also a looming issue for global markets
we obviously have the election coming up which is going to induce a lot of volatility although its not going to have immediate impact on the markets the markets are going to be trying to figure out what the impact of future policies out of dc will have on today but we cant figure that out until we get more clarity around what washington dc is going to look like
one analyst said worries over chinaâs growth prospects played into the falls in asia a surprise move thursday by the countryâs central bank to cut longterm borrowing costs did nothing to lift the mood even strong earnings werenât enough to spare equities south korean chipmaker sk hynix reported its best quarter in six years boosted by ai demand but its shares still plunged around 8 instead money flowed into some assets traditionally seen as safe havens with the japanese yen up more than 1 overnightc copyright thomson reuters 2024 click for restrictions  httpaboutreuterscomfulllegalasp",2024-07-26,Tesla,social

the sampp 500 and nasdaq ended a bumpy session weaker on thursday failing to regain ground lost in the previous days techtriggered selloff the dow added 020 the sampp lost 050 and the nasdaq fell more than 090 all three indexes were up for most of the session on the heels of strongerthanexpected second quarter gdp data megacap stocks traded higher midafternoon only to fall later in the day with meta platforms microsoft and nvidia all ending lower lackluster earnings from both tesla and alphabet had pummeled magnificent seven stocks a day earlier causing the sampp and nasdaq to log their worst day since 2022 alphabets shares dipped again on thursday falling 3 to the stocks lowest close since may 6 but tesla rebounded 2 four more megacap tech companies report earnings next week but while brad bernstein managing director at ubs private wealth management called their results critical its the rest of the market hes excited about
so we actually think the big story in earnings season this month will be the fact that for the first time in two years were going to have earnings growth in the nonmagnificent seven of the sampp 500 so the 493 other stocks that have had no earnings growth as collectively over the last several years are finally going to have earnings growth and we think that bodes very well for the rally to continue because earnings are now growing from other areas within the market
among earningsdriven moves ibm shares jumped more than 4 after the tech company beat estimates for second quarter revenue and raised the annual growth forecast for its software business shares of american airlines rose more than 4 after the company said it had taken swift action to reset its sales and distribution strategy which had driven away corporate travelers meanwhile shares of southwest airlines climbed 55 after saying it would end open seating on its flights on the flip side ford shares plummeted more than 18 after the automakers second quarter adjusted profit missed estimates by a wide marginc copyright thomson reuters 2024 click for restrictions  httpaboutreuterscomfulllegalasp",2024-07-26,Tesla,social

jul 25 2024chicago il – july 25 2024– zacks director of research sheraz mian says looking at q2 as a whole total earnings for the sampp 500 are expected to be up 96 from the same period last year on 49 higher revenues this will be the highest earnings growth pace since the 10 earnings growth in the first quarter of 2022note the following is an excerpt from this weeks earnings trends report you can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods please click heregtgtgtfor immediate releasewill mag 7 earnings meet expectationshere are the key pointsfor the 134 sampp 500 companies that have reported q2 results or 268 of the indexs total membership total earnings are up 76 from the same period last year on 47 higher revenues with 813 beating eps estimates and 575 beating revenue estimatesexcept for the revenue beats percentage which at 575 is the lowest for this group of 134 index members over the preceding 20quarter period all of the other performance metrics are tracking better relative to what we have seen in other recent periodslooking at q2 as a whole total earnings for the index are expected to be up 96 from the same period last year on 49 higher revenues this will be the highest earnings growth pace since the 10 earnings growth in the first quarter of 2022q2 earnings for the magnificent 7 companies are expected to be up 266 from the same period last year on 136 higher revenues excluding the mag 7 q2 earnings growth for the rest of the index drops to 61 from 96alphabetgoogl and tesla tsla kicked off the q2 reporting cycle for the magnificent 7 stocks with the market unimpressed with either of the two reports this contrasted with the companies q1 releases when both alphabet and tesla were up big on the quarterly resultsthere is no surprise in the tesla selloff as the company not only missed estimates but also had nothing good to say about the nearterm outlook the ev maker has been suffering competitive challenges in its core market prompting it to cut prices that are weighing on its margins as a result teslas q2 earnings were down 453 on 23 higher revenues given tesla shares gain of more than 40 in the threemonth period ahead of the quarterly release the postrelease selloff makes perfect sensethe selloff in alphabet shares is far harder to understand as the search giant handily beat estimates and showed broadly positive trends in all of its businessesthe issue in the alphabet report appears to be the markets disappointment with a biggerthanexpected capital spending level in the period of 132 billion relative to expectations of 122 billion management also indicated that they saw underspending as a bigger risk at this stage of the ai rollout than the alternative which was interpreted as indicative of an elevated capex spend trend than what investors had been factoring inwe dont see elevated capex by alphabet or any other tech operator as a negative but this appears to be the case with tech investors at this stage perhaps the market would like to see a tangible path toward monetization for all the aicentric investments in which alphabet and its peers are currently engaged in this also means that capex spending levels in the coming meta and microsoft reports will similarly receive close scrutinyfor the mag 7 group as a whole q2 earnings are expected to be up 266 on 136 higher revenuesbeyond the mag 7 q2 earnings for the tech sector as a whole are expected to be up 163 from the same period last year the revisions trend for the tech sector has been positive for a while now which is important since the sector alone is on track to bring in almost 30 of all sampp 500 earnings over the coming fourquarter periodfor fullyear 2024 tech sector earnings are expected to be up 172 followed by another strong showing expected next yeara big contributing factor to the tech sectors positive earnings outlook is the sectors margins outlookwe are already in record territory with tech sector margins with 2024 margins expected to exceed last years record level the expectation is for some more gains next year and the year after with the evergrowing share of highermargin software and services in the overall tech earnings pie explaining the favorable trend part of this likely also reflects optimism about the impact of ai on the sectors productivitythe earnings big pictureplease note that this years 87 earnings growth on only 17 topline gains reflects revenue weakness in the finance sector excluding the finance sector the earnings growth pace changes to 85 and the revenue growth rate improves to 39 in other words about half of this years earnings growth comes from revenue growth with margin gains accounting for the reston the margins front 11 of the 16 zacks sectors are expected to have higher margins in 2024 relative to last year with tech finance and consumer discretionary as the big gainerswhy havent you

us secondquarter gdp surprises to the upside welcome to trading at noon i am thomas warner data showed the us economy grew faster than expected in the second quarter annualized growth of 28 came in well above estimates of 20 but inflation as measured by the core pce price index subsided leaving expectations of a september rate cut intact separate report showed weekly jobless claims fell more than expected as distortions from the weather and temporary automobile plant closures faded turning to the equity markets now and the main us indexes opening mixed with the sampp and nasdaq dipping in and out of positive territory this after the nasdaq suffered its worst day since 2022 on wednesday investors assessed strongerthanexpected gdp data but remained cautious after suffering that tech mauling in the previous session us treasury yields meanwhile fell for a third day on thursday as investors piled into shorterdated bonds in anticipation of rate cuts the global selloff in tech stocks and other risk assets also fanned the push into safe haven assets the gap between 2year and 10year treasury yields hits its narrowest since october 2023 and was just a whisker below where it was in july 2022 in outright terms nvidia microsoft and apple were among this mornings heaviest fallers on the sampp 500 nvidia is down nearly 16 from its alltime high back in june meta alphabet and amazon all also traded lower but tesla bucked the trend up 3 after its worst day in nearly four years yesterday one analyst that we spoke to said that traders are reassessing the entire sector
i think there is some caution obviously alphabet did beat expectations but not by enough to create upward momentum in the stock and tesla had a pretty broadbased miss but ultimately i think there is a questioning of traders of how much more money is going to be needed to invest in ai and when is that payoff ultimately going to play out

question marks about global growth will prove to be problematic for the eurozone so we have seen those forwardlooking survey indicators retreating quite significantly expectations within the ifo survey dipped below the current reading and that is a rather negative backdrop so i think that does suggest that the euro macroeconomic projections are going to be challenged

tech stocks fall heavily as investors sour on the mega caps this is your us morning call im thomas warner stock markets around the world were locked in a multitrilliondollar tailspin on thursday lackluster results from tesla after the bell on tuesday started an investor stampede out of the tech mega caps the nasdaq closed nearly 4 down yesterday and the contagion spread to asia and europe overnight more than 3 trillion has been wiped off world stocks in the last three days futures trading this morning suggests the equity markets may be starting to stabilize wall streets major indexes look to be trading flat to lower this morning but tesla and nvidia both continued to lose ground premarket one analyst that we spoke to says that tesla now represents a golden opportunity
i think its going to be a very opportunistic buy here given this entry point in the confusion surrounding the stock and you got to bet on elon especially with the potential republican white house going forward because hes very very proactive and public about his relationship with the republican leadership and i think that will only serve to help his investments and if hes helping his investments you want to be on his side with your investments
meanwhile markets are convinced that the fed will have to cut rates in september the cme fedwatch tool now puts the chances of at least a 25basispoint cut at more than 98 up from 90 yesterday the slump also prompted flight into safe haven assets like bonds and the yen which hit a twoandahalfmonth high relative to the dollar overnight shortdated bonds got an extra boost from former new york fed president william dudley who says the us central bank should cut rates next week rather than waiting until september the market still sees the chance of that being just 11 turning to today now and commerce department data out at 830 eastern is expected to show the economy grew an annualized 2 in the second quarter that compares with 14 in the first quarter when consumers slowed spending in the face of higher rates separately durable goods are expected to have gained 03 in june after rising 01 in may and initial claims for state unemployment benefits likely fell back from 10month highs during the week to july 20 it got a temporary lift the previous week because of hurricane beryl the labor market is gradually cooling as the federal reserves rate increases from 2022 and 2023 slow demand earnings season continues on thursday southwest airlines reported lower q2 profits this morning but the fall was lower than forecast owing to successful cost cutting american airlines will also report on thursday flight demand is at record levels this summer but united delta alaska and ryanair have all delivered downbeat outlooks the sector is grappling with overcapacity as airlines thought demand would be even higher union pacific is expected to report a secondquarter profit above estimates price hikes and a pickup in vehicle shipments are seen offsetting a fall in demand from coal transporters and that is your us morning callc copyright thomson reuters 2024 click for restrictions  httpaboutreuterscomfulllegalasp",2024-07-25,Tesla,social

20a of the securities exchange act of 1934 on behalf of investors in
uipath securities between december 1 2023 and the close of trading on may
29 2024 inclusive the class period the case is pending in the us
district court for the southern district of new york and is captioned zack
steiner v uipath inc no 124cv4702 a copy of the lawsuit can be
found httpswwwbfalawcomsitefilescasesshowtemppdf

     what is the lawsuit about

     the complaint alleges that throughout the class period defendants
made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of
uipaths turnaround strategy for instance defendants represented that the
company was executing against that strategy and were seeing the results
in the deal quality and the customer quality asserted that our strategic
investments in innovations and our gotomarket ecosystem positions us well
for continued momentum and that theres no doubt theres been better
execution since the implementation of the turnaround strategy

     these statements were allegedly materially false and misleading in
truth uipaths turnaround strategy had failed fruitless investments and
inconsistent execution plagued the companys overhauled gotomarket
strategy additionally uipaths aipowered business automation platform
caused confusion among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled
as a result uipath experienced significant difficulties closing andor
expanding large multiyear deals

     on may 29 2024 uipath announced the sudden departure of ceo robert
enslin on the same day uipath announced disappointing 1q 25 financial
results and significantly cut its fy 25 revenue guidance by 10 or 150
million the company attributed the poor results and guidance to several
factors related to its failed turnaround strategy including an inadequate
execution strategy to scale the companys aipowered growth products to
reach their full potential and that ai had createed a little bit of
confusion with our customers ui path also described how the investments we
have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations
and made us less agile in responding to customer needs while experiencing
contract execution challenges on large deals

     this news caused the price of uipath stock to decline 623 per share
or more than 34 from 1830 per share on may 29 2024 to 1207 per
share on may 30 2024 resulting in significant harm to investors

a growing number of investigations and legal complaints are targeting teslas claims that its cars are full selfdriving scrutinizing the companys decisions to brand and market its suite of driverassistance technologies for evidence of potential fraudthe us justice department is probing the companys marketing of both full selfdriving and autopilot teslas advanced driverassistance systems californias department of motor vehicles is also reviewing those features in light of provisions including a 2022 law prohibiting companies from using marketing and language that would lead a reasonable person to believe that the feature allows the vehicle to function as an autonomous vehicle tesla has received inquiries from the securities and exchange commission related to its claims to investors according to news reports and public filings and a civil lawsuit in california represents drivers who say they were defrauded by the companys claims and are seeking refunds and damages over their purchasesat issue is whether the term full selfdriving implies that the cars are autonomous — meaning drivers dont need to pay attention in recent court filings tesla says that the cars are not autonomous and that its user manuals and sensors alert drivers to the need to hold the wheel and keep their eyes on the road yet in a post on x last month teslas head of autopilot ashok elluswamy used the word writing that the cars have the most autonomous capability compared to any production cartesla ceo elon musk and elluswamy did not respond to requests for comment the justice department and the securities and exchange commission through spokespeople declined to commentthe wave of scrutiny comes less than a month before tesla is due to unveil what it calls a robotaxi a dedicated vehicle that would run a version of its full selfdriving software shuttling passengers between destinations without a driver it has no known production timeline and tesla is known for making ambitious product announcements without concrete delivery plansmany of the probes and lawsuits weigh similar claims made by muskmost tesla cars today come with a feature it calls autopilot a suite of software that allows vehicles to keep their distance behind others maintain a set speed and steer on highways following the trajectory of lane lines the company has for years offered an upgrade package called full selfdriving which costs 8000 down from 15000 — or 99 a month — and enables its vehicles to navigate city and residential streets on their own provided the driver demonstrates they are paying attentiontesla promised customers years ago that this upgrade would turn cars into an appreciable asset — meaning their value would increase over time — after they one day become autonomous through a software update that has yet to happen and thats what the california lawsuit is aboutcontrary to teslas repeated promises that it would have a fully selfdriving car within months or a year tesla has never been remotely close to achieving that goal reads the civil complaint in us district court for the northern district of california which is seeking classaction certification in addition to financial remedies it asks for an injunction prohibiting tesla from continuing to market its technology in deceptive and misleading waysone of the arguments we make is you cant get more selfdriving than fully selfdriving said attorney andrew kirtley who is representing customers in the autopilot classaction suitamong the statements under scrutiny according to interviews and documents musks 2019 pronouncement that tesla would put 1 million robotaxis on the road by 2020 and teslas assertions that its vehicles have all the hardware needed to deploy the full selfdriving feature the northern california civil lawsuit specifically cites musks assertion on a 2016 conference call that a tesla would be able to drive itself from los angeles to new york by the end of next year without the need for a single touchin that case drivers allege that they were misled into paying for a feature that still hasnt materialized meanwhile at least two dozen people have died in crashes in which teslas driverassistance features were engaged according to the national highway traffic safety administration in some cases they were alleged to be driving under the influence or distractedin teslas response to the california lawsuit the company claims its driverassistance features — including steering accelerating and merging — make the cars selfdriving but not autonomous it has made the same claim on its website saying that autopilot and full selfdriving features do not make the vehicle autonomous and that its systems are intended to be used only with a fully attentive driverbut legal experts question the distinction when i hear selfdriving and autonomous i kind of hear the same thing said anthony casey a university of chicago law professor adding that the legal question will revolve around what would a normal person hear in the term selfdrivingstill he said the bar for proving that teslas marketing claims amount to fraud particularly criminal fraud is high you also would have to show that they intended to get a person to buy it by misleading you casey saidtesla is far from the first company to tussle with regulators and federal officials over the ambitious promises of its tech legal experts said other companies in similar situations have made the same argument tesla is making that failure to deliver on its promises is not a crimean attorney for elizabeth holmes the disgraced silicon valley wunderkind who promoted a medical device that could purportedly perform a battery tests with a tiny amount of blood made this argument explicitly during holmess 2021 criminal trial failure is not a crime the attorney argued trying your hardest and coming up short is not a crime a jury disagreed holmes was convicted and is serving an 11year prison sentencein the ongoing justice department probe investigators have focused on teslas promises according to john bernal a former tesla autopilot employee who was interviewed by an fbi agent and a representative of the us transportation department for five hours in 2022they kept saying over and over again their focus is in terms of marketing with the namesake bernal said referring to terms such as autopilot and full selfdriving they believe that those namesakes imply a higher sense of functionality than they actually deliverbernal said their main holy grail info they were seeking was they wanted physical written documentation in advertisement or marketing form that tesla was billing its driverassistance systems as autonomous bernal did not have evidence of that he said he said the officials told him their investigation had stretched back to 2018 and involved interviews with numerous employeesfederal officials have focused at least in part on a 2016 tesla marketing video set to the rolling stones song paint it black that purported to show a tesla maneuvering near the companys headquarters on its own which came up repeatedly in the interview with bernal the person in the drivers seat is only there for legal reasons the 2016 videos opening slide reads he is not doing anything the car is driving itselfa tesla official later acknowledged after reporting by the new york times that the video was staged and the car in fact crashed during filmingat the time musk was deep into a push to make teslas capable of autonomy an effort that led to heated backandforths between him and the engineers responsible for delivering at one point musk left a car during a test drive after the software performed badly slamming the door shut and walking back toward teslas officesnothing fing works musk fumed before storming off according to a person with knowledge of the episode speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of retributiona recent musk biography said musk frequently would show up to teslas office dismayed by the softwares performancea few months after the incident newly detailed by the washington post tesla released the paint it black videotesla in response to another lawsuit called the video an aspirational demonstration of its softwares potential capabilitiessimilar videos have been used in other cases — even against another electric vehicle manufacturer trevor milton the founder of electric truck startup nikola was found guilty of misleading investors in a federal fraud case that alleged a video demonstration of its trucks capabilities in reality showed the truck rolling downhill rather than propelling itself on its owncarl tobias a university of richmond law professor said the civil case would be most likely to gain momentum in the short term given the extended nature of federal investigations and the lower burden of proof in civil casesthere were some representations especially video that they made … look better than it actually was he said and i think people felt manipulated in that context that they overrated how quickly they could do things or how well it could perform and that kind of thing as a sales techniquetobias said customers reliance on those claims could entitle them to refundsmusk had been pushing for autonomous capability in his cars for years in ways that were at times inconsistent with teslas level of progress and to the chagrin of safety officials who had not anticipated such a brazen effort to bill consumer vehicles as selfdriving the post has reportedaround late 2014 software entrepreneur dan odowd said hed learned musk was planning to deliver an autonomous vehicle by the end of the following year now a vocal tesla critic odowd was at the time a contractor for tesla whose company helped streamline the autopilot technology to take up less computer spacein 2019 musk made another audacious promise to put 1 million robotaxis on the road by 2020 in part by utilizing the privately owned teslas sitting in peoples driveways the fleet wakes up with an overtheair update musk said at the timethat didnt happen instead tesla has focused on smaller developments releasing the first iteration of its full selfdriving software known as full selfdriving beta in late 2020 followed by successive improvements such as better recognition of road signs and lane markings and aiming for smoother driving musk launched the latest version of the software known as v12 this year touting it as a revolutionary leap forwardin april musk made a new promise tesla robotaxi unveil on 88 he wrote on thursday however bloomberg news reported that tesla planned to delay the event to octobertom gorman former senior counsel in the secs division of enforcement said musks robotaxi statements could also be reviewed by the agency which would scrutinize the promises in light of investor decisions musks robotaxi promise was made amid slumping stock prices in the first half of 2024if he really doesnt have the ability to do what hes doing … theyd go after him for that gorman said if youre saying i am going to have a completely selfdriving car and it can drive you around the planet completely by yourself two weeks

teslas shares are down 28 this year it has warned of notably slower growth as sales in its secondlargest market china fall a defect forced a recall of its highly anticipated latest product the chief executive spends a lot of time at other companies or generating controversy how do you reward him with a recordbreaking 56bn pay deal if tesla gets its way at its annual meeting on thursdayelon musks pay package – the largest ever granted to an executive at a uslisted company – is not based on teslas current or future performance it was granted in 2018 and built around targets for teslas stock value revenue and profitabilitythe targets seemed steep at the time but after three extraordinary surges – in tesla production demand for electric cars and the groups share price – every goal was cleared by 2022 the companys transformation into the worlds most highly valued carmaker propelled musk into the ranks of the worlds very richest peopleback in january a judge slammed on the brakes voiding the pay arrangement after a legal challenge by a tesla shareholder the delaware court of chancery called his remuneration an unfathomable sum and questioned whether compensating musk at such levels was necessary to retain him as chief executive and achieve the companys goalstesla was not prepared to take that decision in its stride elon has not been paid for any of his work for tesla for the past six years that has helped to generate significant growth and stockholder value robyn denholm teslas chair said in april adding that the ruling had been fundamentally unfair and inconsistent with the will of the stockholders who voted for itthe company organised a revote urging investors to endorse the deal again while the carmaker has sought to underline how the arrangement was tied to previous performance the ballot is also seen by some as a referendum on the current state of the company and musks leadershipdenholm appealed to shareholders again last week saying there was a risk musk would step back from tesla if they did not back his pay package this week if tesla is to retain elons attention and motivate him to continue to devote his time energy ambition and vision to deliver comparable results in the future we must stand by our deal she wrotedenholm added this is obviously not about the money we all know elon is one of the wealthiest people on the planet and he would remain so even if tesla were to renege on the commitment we made in 2018investors are being asked to endorse two proposals musks pay and the relocation of teslas incorporation from delaware to texas musk signalled he planned to do the latter after januarys ruling which prompted him to say that companies should never incorporate in delawaretesla is likely to win approval for musks remuneration according to dan ives an analyst at wedbush and a veteran follower of the company albeit not by a wide margin many shareholders in the company understand the biggest asset of tesla is elon musk ives saidthe two largest proxy advisory firms – which advise investors on how to vote – have come out against musks pay glass lewis and iss both described it as excessive prompting angry responses from tesla glass lewis had used faulty logic it claimed while suggesting that iss had missed the pointbeyond the ramifications for musks wealth the vote over his pay will also test the power that proxy advisers wield over a company such as tesla which has a multitude of loyal supporters and musk fans among its shareholderstesla and musk have mounted a highprofile campaign to ensure they win last month the billionaire shared a glossy video on x the social network formerly known as twitter that he bought and renamed which he claimed tesla staff had made of their own volition it urged investors to protect tesla by voting for the carmakers proposals warning that future growth was on the linemusk has received support from some deeppocketed backers without his relentless drive and uncompromising standards there would be no tesla the billionaire investor ron baron said last weekthat drive has earned the tycoon his fair share of critics trade unions are attempting to organise inside tesla plants claiming it is high time the companys workers were handed their fair share of its profitshe faces questions too over how he divides his time with the rest of his empire which includes x the rockets and satellites group spacex neuralink a brain implant startup and the boring company a tunnelling venturetesla will ultimately be victorious in the narrative where if its not for musk we dont have the ev electric vehicle transformation globally that weve seen said ives he deserves the pay package he executedbut its at a time when tesla is going through a difficult growth period theres category 5 headwinds and musk has created a lot of noise and controversy which has frustrated some investorsvictory on thursday is unlikely to end the saga shareholders who oppose musks pay deal are expected to challenge any effort to reinstate itcopyright c 2024 observertheguardiancomnonsyndicated,2024-06-08,Tesla,governance

     why rosen law we encourage investors to select qualified counsel with
a track record of success in leadership roles often firms issuing notices
do not have comparable experience resources or any meaningful peer
recognition many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class
actions but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law
firms that actually litigate the cases  be wise in selecting counsel the
rosen law firm represents investors throughout the globe concentrating its
practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation
rosen law firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action
settlement against a chinese company rosen law firm was ranked no 1 by
iss securities class action services for number of securities class action

lawdragon and super lawyers

the class period made materially false andor misleading statements andor
failed to disclose that 1 toyota understated its malfeasance relating to
certification of its cars and issues relating to overall legal compliance
and 2 as a result defendants statements about its business operations
and prospects were materially false and misleading andor lacked a

 the unmistakable futuristic hum from passing vehicles on the road signals
a new era in transportation and mobility the automotive industry is
transforming with new ownership models cuttingedge connectivity and
innovative advanced electrified powertrains

 but with change comes questions why are automakers focusing so much on
electrified powertrains what does this shift marked by the futuristic
hum really mean for consumers and is this transformation really
necessary

 at the core it comes down to carbon dioxide co2 emissions co2 is
essential to life on earth but too much poses a threat when in balance
co2 helps keep planet earth warm enough to sustain life however an
imbalance can lead to a much warmer average temperature which can lead to
bringing forward the predicted results of climate change

 but where does this excess co2 come from natural sources make up the
majority of co2 released into the atmosphere oceans animal and plant
respiration organic matter decomposition forest fires and emissions from
volcanic eruptions

 another contributor to co2 emissions is human activity including power
generation industrial sources chemical production agricultural
practices and transportation of all sectors transportation accounts for
the largest percentage of greenhouse gas ghg emissions in the united
states coming in at 28 between 1990 and 2021r ghg emissions within the
transportation sector including carbon dioxide increased more than any
other humanbased activity science has shown that co2 is a contributing
factor to climate change and as such efforts by governments companies
and individuals to reduce or eliminate co2 emissions are gaining momentum
after all co2 emissions can remain in the atmosphere for hundreds of
years and the impact of emissions in one region can be felt globally

 as automobile tailpipes are prevalently visible by so many people each
day transportation especially the automotive industry has become a focal
point fortunately various solutions are being deployed regulations
incentives innovative products technologies and services are converging
to combat co2

 to explore these critical topics a compelling threepart video series
driving decarbonization in america has been produced by bader media group
funded by toyota hosted by ross butler with field reporting from neka zang
and ariana cohen the series immerses viewers in the world of co2 emissions
and what is being done in the automotive industry examining what carbon
dioxide and greenhouse gases are the series delves into the relentless
drive to reduce or eliminate co2 from new vehicles by exploring the
various vehicle types powertrains and technologies that have shaped  and
continue to shape  the industry landscape viewers are taken on a dynamic
journey that spans past present and future innovations in sustainable
mobility

 providing a rare glimpse into the automakers perspective the series
hosts speak with the worlds largest manufacturer toyota providing an
indepth look at their multipathway approach to vehicles and technology
alongside other companies dedicated todriving decarbonization

 the series will airon motortrend tv with availability on the discovery go

 in the series viewers will learn

 from subject matter experts

 the series will provide viewers with valuable knowledge shared by
industryanalysts researchers engineers thinktanks and company
executives these experts will discuss the significance of carbon dioxide
emissions and how combined efforts are driving decarbonization

 vehicle electrification

 a portfolio of low and zeroemission vehicles are currently available and
are helping reduce co2 emissions today hybrid plugin hybrid fuel cell
and battery electric vehicles will be discussed shedding light on how
choices can help consumers find a way to reduce their carbon dioxide
emissions

 automotive batteries

 the push towards electrification means more automotive batteries while
having more battery electric vehicles on the road may mean less
tailpipeemissions what about other sources of emissions are we just
shifting co2 emissions from the tailpipe to somewhere else innovations in
battery recycling and ways to optimize supply chain logistics will be key
to this growing area

 existing vehicles

 there is a significant emphasis on new vehicles and their emissions but
what about the vehicles that are not electrified even with the most
optimistic projections indicating that 50 or more of new vehicle sales in
the united states will be battery electric by 2032 the fact remains that a
large portion of vehicles on the road will still have internal combustion
engines meaning they may still emit carbon dioxide if reducing carbon is
so important and a priority is there a solution that can help reduce co2
emissions from these and other legacy vehicles

 utilityenergy systems

 electric vehicles also bring with them the possibility of bidirectional
charging where electricity can be taken off the grid to charge the
batteries but also flow the other way but when is the best time to
charge and is the electricity being used coming from renewable energy
sources how can vehicles become a tool for utility companies to help make
the overall energy grid more resilient

 join us as we follow ross journey as he explores the increasingly
important topics of the future of transportation and co2 emissions through
this threepart series this summer

unmistakable futuristic hum from passing vehicles on the road signals a new era in transportation and mobility the automotive industry is transforming with new ownership models cuttingedge connectivity and innovative advanced electrified powertrainsbut with change comes questions why are automakers focusing so much on electrified powertrains what does this shift marked by the futuristic hum really mean for consumers and is this transformation really necessaryat the core it comes down to carbon dioxide co2 emissions co2 is essential to life on earth but too much poses a threat when in balance co2 helps keep planet earth warm enough to sustain life however an imbalance can lead to a much warmer average temperature which can lead to bringing forward the predicted results of climate changebut where does this excess co2 come from natural sources make up the majority of co2 released into the atmosphere oceans animal and plant respiration organic matter decomposition forest fires and emissions from volcanic eruptionsanother contributor to co2 emissions is human activity including power generation industrial sources chemical production agricultural practices and transportation of all sectors transportation accounts for the largest percentage of greenhouse gas ghg emissions in the united states coming in at 28 between 1990 and 2021r ghg emissions within the transportation sector including carbon dioxide increased more than any other humanbased activity science has shown that co2 is a contributing factor to climate change and as such efforts by governments companies and individuals to reduce or eliminate co2 emissions are gaining momentum after all co2 emissions can remain in the atmosphere for hundreds of years and the impact of emissions in one region can be felt globallyas automobile tailpipes are prevalently visible by so many people each day transportation especially the automotive industry has become a focal point fortunately various solutions are being deployed regulations incentives innovative products technologies and services are converging to combat co2to explore these critical topics a compelling threepart video series driving decarbonization in america has been produced by bader media group funded by toyota hosted by ross butler with field reporting from neka zang and ariana cohen the series immerses viewers in the world of co2 emissions and what is being done in the automotive industry examining what carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases are the series delves into the relentless drive to reduce or eliminate co2 from new vehicles by exploring the various vehicle types powertrains and technologies that have shaped – and continue to shape – the industry landscape viewers are taken on a dynamic journey that spans past present and future innovations in sustainable mobilityproviding a rare glimpse into the automakers perspective the series hosts speak with the worlds largest manufacturer toyota providing an indepth look at their

portfolio of low and zeroemission vehicles are currently available and are helping reduce co2 emissions today hybrid plugin hybrid fuel cell and battery electric vehicles will be discussed shedding light on how choices can help consumers find a way to reduce their carbon dioxide emissionsautomotive batteriesthe push towards electrification means more automotive batteries while having more battery electric vehicles on the road may mean less tailpipeemissions what about other sources of emissions are we just shifting co2 emissions from the tailpipe to somewhere else innovations in battery recycling and ways to optimize supply chain logistics will be key to this growing areaexisting vehiclesthere is a significant emphasis on new vehicles and their emissions but what about the vehicles that are not electrified even with the most optimistic projections indicating that 50 or more of new vehicle sales in the united states will be battery electric by 2032 the fact remains that a large portion of vehicles on the road will still have internal combustion engines meaning they may still emit carbon dioxide if reducing carbon is so important and a priority is there a solution that can help reduce co2 emissions from these and other legacy vehiclesutilityenergy systemselectric vehicles also bring with them the possibility of bidirectional charging where electricity can be taken off the grid to charge the batteries but also flow the other way but when is the best time to charge and is the electricity being used coming from renewable energy sources how can vehicles

the transport ministry has concluded that six cases of misconduct by toyota motor corp related to vehicle certification may violate not only domestic standards but also un vehicle regulations it has been learnedthe un vehicle regulations are international safety and environmental standards that have been adopted by 62 countries and regions including japan south korea and europe given that japans domestic regulations for cars accord with those of the united nations the irregularities are highly likely to result in manufacturers being barred from massproducing the vehicles involved in the scandal in europe and elsewheremonday marked one week since the land infrastructure transport and tourism ministry announced five vehicle manufacturers had engaged in misconduct over model certification  a requirement for the mass production of automobiles and motorcycles the ministry will use the results of onsite inspections conducted at each company to consider administrative action based on the road transport vehicle law according to the ministry because japan has adopted the un vehicle regulations any vehicle manufacturer that obtains model certification in japan is automatically eligible for the same certification in 61 countries and regions including the united kingdom germany france italy and south korea without completing additional certification tests at each location this procedure  called mutual recognition  helps reduce the burden on manufacturers operating overseasirregularities were found in six tests at toyota including the following 1 offset frontal collision tests which evaluate the degree of passenger protection 2 pedestrian head and leg protection performance tests 3 rear collision tests and 4 engine power tests these tests are also included in the un vehicle regulations which means they violate them as wellwhile toyota claims that it conducted some tests under stricter conditions than the national requirement the ministry concluded that was not necessarily the caseconcerning pedestrian protection tests aimed at measuring the impact to the head of a pedestrian hit by a car toyota said at a press conference on june 3 that the company had used its development test data which utilizes an impact angle of 65 degrees rather than the required 50 degrees while the company apologized and said it should have conducted the test once more with an impact angle of 50 degrees it claimed that 65 degrees was a stricter testhowever according to sources close to the government the strictness of a safety test depends on such factors as the shape of the cars hood the difference in the angle alone is not a determining factor toyota also claimed that other tests were conducted under stricter conditions than required however the government believes it is impossible to say whether that was true in all cases instead it is highly likely that europe and other regions will consider toyotas misconduct to be a violation of regulationsin the wake of the scandal some manufacturers have called on the government to streamline the system of vehicle certification itself to ensure international competitiveness and for other reasons however the transport ministry is highly concerned that reducing domestic standards that accord with those of the united nations will lead to a loss of mutual recognition for domestic manufacturers which would adversely affect their overseas operationsthe five companies toyota mazda motor corp yamaha motor co honda motor co and suzuki motor corp insist that the 38 models involved in the scandal meet domestic standards and that people can continue to drive them without a problem however the transport ministry plans to perform its own tests on these models the discovery of a deviation from government standards may trigger a recall in and outside japan,2024-06-11,Toyota,environment

 fuelcell energy and toyota motor north america celebrate
 launch of worlds first trigen production system at the
 port of long beach

st

   fuelcell energys trigen technology produces three products renewable
electricity renewable hydrogen and usable water

   marks toyotas first port vehicle processing facility in the world to
be powered by onsitegenerated 100 percent renewable electricity

   both lightduty and class 8 heavyduty fuel cell electric vehicles have
been fueled using trigen generated renewable hydrogen

et

     fuelcell energy inc and toyota motor north america inc toyotaare
celebrating the grand opening ofthe firstofitskind trigen systemat
the port of long beach california today trigen uses biogas to produce
renewable electricity renewable hydrogen and usable water and was built
to support the vehicle processing and distribution center for toyota
logistics services tls at long beach toyotas largest north american
vehicle processing facility that receives approximately 200000 new toyota
and lexus vehicles annually

     the goal of our collaboration with fuelcell energy was to find
sustainable solutions for the tls vehicle processing facility here at the
port of long beach as part of our goal to remove carbon dioxide emissions
from our operations said group vice president of sustainability and
regulatory affairs at toyota tom stricker this groundbreaking facility
shows that there are ways to reduce our emissions and burden on natural
resources with scalable technology based on hydrogen

     thanks to fuelcell energys trigen platform tls long beach is
toyotas first port vehicle processing facility powered by 100 percent
onsite generated renewable electricity fuelcell energys innovative fuel
cell technology uses an electrochemical process that converts directed
renewable biogas into electricity hydrogen and usable water with a highly
efficient combustionfree process that emits virtually no air pollutants

     trigen demonstrates that hydrogenbased energy can benefit
businesses deliver zeroemission transportation for light and heavyduty
vehicles support improved air quality in local communities reduce water
usage and deliver immediate and longterm benefits to the environment
fuelcell energy ceo and president jason few said as a company we are
living our purpose when we enable visionary customers like toyota to
decarbonize their operations and harness the energy solutions offered by
hydrogenall while leaving communities with cleaner air and easing the
strain on power grids and water supplies

     trigen produces 23megawatts of renewable electricity part of which
will be utilized by tls long beach to support its operations at the port
excess electricity is delivered to the local utility southern california
edison under the california bioenergy market adjustment tariff biomat
program adding a renewable resilient and affordable baseload electric
generation resource to the electric grid

     trigen can also produce up to 1200 kgday of hydrogen for the
fueling needs of toyotas incoming lightduty fuel cell electric vehicle
fcev mirai while also supplying hydrogen to the adjacent heavyduty
hydrogen refueling station to support tls logistics and drayage operations
at the port as of january 1 2024 californias advanced clean fleet
regulation will only allow zeroemission trucks to newly register as
drayage trucks by 2035 all drayage trucks will be required to be
zeroemission the trigen platform supports fcev class 8 trucks today and
is there to support ongoing migration to zero emission trucks between now
and 2035 hydrogen production can be ramped up and down based on
demandsince completing construction last year in january of this year
toyota used the renewable hydrogen produced at trigen to fill the first
toyota mirai vehicles at tls and in april the first heavyduty fcev
kenworth t680 class 8 truck was filled at the adjacent shell hd filling
station using trigenproduced renewable hydrogen

     the water byproduct of hydrogen generation can produce up to 1400
gallons of usable water per day which is being repurposed for tlscar wash
operations for vehicles that come into port before customer delivery this
helps reduce the demand on the constrained local water supplies by
approximately half a million gallons per year

     supporting port of long beach initiatives

     by supporting tls operations at the port of long beach trigen is
expected to help reduce more than 9000 tons of co emissions from the power
grid each year this supports both toyota logistics services carbon
reduction goals as well as the port of long beachs goals as a leader in
innovative solutions to reducing carbon emissions

     the dawn of the renewable hydrogen era is upon us thanks to our
collaboration with toyota andfuelcell energy and their innovative trigen
system said port of long beach ceo mario cordero the green power
generated by the trigen system and similar projects is part of our
multilayered strategy to fuel our goal to become the worlds first
zeroemissions port

     trigen will also help avoid more than six tons of grid nox emissions
which are harmful to both people and the environment today using
hydrogenpowered fuel cell class 8 trucks in port operations has the
potential to reduce diesel consumption by more than 420000 gallons per
year

     fuelcell energy and toyotas collaborative effort signifies
technological innovation and also positions long beach at the forefront of
global leadership in renewable energy solutions said long beach mayor
rex richardson this transformative initiative solidifies our citys
status as a trailblazer in green initiatives and shows our dedication to a
cleaner more sustainable future for our community and beyond

the office workspace at the new h2hq was recently redesigned for its teams
working from research and development to commercialization planning and
sales of hydrogenrelated products and technologies there are plans to add
key features to the h2hq campus in the future such as a flexible microgrid
sustainable customer education center and more

     toyota has developed hydrogen fuel cell electric solutions for more
than three decades and we will continue to advance this scalable
zeroemission technology as part of our electrified portfolio said ted
ogawa president and ceo toyota motor north america renaming this
facility as north american hydrogen headquarters represents our leadership
in fuel cell development creating realworld products to help reduce carbon
emissions

     last year toyota motor corporationreorganized its hydrogen business
in japan to create what it calls hydrogen factory with the idea to bring
all hydrogenrelated work under one location and accelerate
customeroriented product development and production in fuel cell or
hydrogenrelated products then toyota motor europeannounced its own
hydrogen factory with the aim to further grow toyotas hydrogen business
and stimulate wider rollout of hydrogen ecosystems and infrastructure
across europe

     h2hq will drive north americanled hydrogen initiatives and support
the localization of global hydrogenrelated technologies and products that
include lightduty fuel cell applications heavyduty fuel cell
opportunities stationary fuel cell power generation port vehicle
applications and more the facility already provides impressive research
and development assets including toyotas largest dynamometer 12 mw a
scalable test bench for stationary applications and a hydrogen fueling
station capable of providing fuel for both light and heavyduty vehicles
moreover as part of its plans to remain and grow fuel cell leadership na
h2hq will be home to several new projects in the coming years

     im very pleased that toyota is building on its longstanding
commitment to california by locating its north american hydrogen
headquarters here in the golden state said california state senator
district 29 josh newman the work done there along with green hydrogen
initiatives throughout the state is propelling california toward a
dynamic cleanenergy economy which will also reduce carbon emissions and
foster environmental stewardship while extending californias leadership in
this important space

     construction has begun on a flexible microgrid that features energy
sources available today including a 230kw solar photovoltaic system a
1mw stationary proton exchange membrane pem fuel cell generator 325kw
solid oxide fuel cell sofc and an onsite 500kwh battery energy storage
system the microgrid is designed to support the campus energy needs
allowing it the ability to operate offgrid the system is expected to be
fully operational by 2026

     california has ambitious goals to achieve clean air carbon
neutrality and a vibrant economy toyotas investment to expand their
research and development of hydrogen fuel cell technology in our state is
an example of the innovation that will accelerate the development and
deployment of zeroemissions transportation options particularly as we
decarbonize the goods movement sector said carb chair liane randolph

     in the future toyotas plans for the new north american hydrogen hq
will include a sustainable education center available for tours by
reservation the center will be a place for people to learn more about
toyotas vision of sustainability and the role that hydrogen will play

     30 years of development

     from creating one of the worlds first mass market passenger fuel cell
electric vehicles in themirai to applying and scaling the technology now
to other applications that can benefit from zeroemissions
includingheavyduty transportpower generation systemsand others toyotas
research and development with hydrogen fuel cell technology spans more than
30 years

     for much of that time the gardena office supported or initiated a
wide range of fuel cell electric projects to share some recent examples
the fuel cell development fcd team was instrumental in supporting the
development of toyotas lightduty mirai launched back in 2015 and the
team collaborated with industry partners to help support infrastructure
growth through the state of california

     in 2017 to address decarbonization efforts at local ports toyotas
fcd team helped prove the scalability of fuel cell technology after it
acquired a class 8 truck and fitted it with a fuel cell electric powertrain
consisting of two mirai fuelcell stacks this effort then led to a
collaboration with paccars kenworth brand to build 10 proofofconcept
trucks trucks used to support the shore to store zanzeff project that
proved the viability of hydrogenpowered fuel cells as a zeroemission
powertrain in heavyduty applications paccar and toyota later agreed in
2023 to pursue commercialization of the project with toyota supplying the
fuel cell powertrain kits from its kentucky plant as a tier 1 supplier

     most recently toyota has demonstrated a nonautomotive opportunity
for hydrogenpowered fuel cell technology in stationary power generation
toyota and trd partnered to build a stationary unit to provide electricity
at events where it was not readily available launching the first public
activation at an lpga tour stop where the unit supported the power needs of
the event stage and sound system the solution provided clean quiet power
that was proven to capably replace traditional diesel generators last
year toyota built a 1mw fuel cell electric generator for the national
renewable energy laboratory in colorado to support microgrid testing at the
facility and finally earlier this year toyota collaborated with kohler
on a prototype stationary generator to provide backup emergency power for
klickitat valley health hospital in goldendale washington

asian stocks stabilize as a wild week winds down welcome to asia markets briefing im ramzan karmali well the yen stabilised near a 12week high against the dollar on friday while asiapacific equity markets found their feet a day after their worst session since midapril south korean shares rose as chipmakers rebounded but also financials rallied in response to government tax cut proposals tech stocks also boosted the nifty 50 which had experienced five straight sessions of losses taiwan stocks fell more than 4 as investors there joined a global tech grant after a typhoon shut the markets for two days tsmc the worlds largest chipmaker and major apple supplier saw its shares fall over 6 at one point well apple smartphone shipments in china fell by 67 in the second quarter of 2024 in contrast huawei smartphone shipments surged over the same period the data from canalys a market research firm also showed that the american techgiantâs market share decreased from 16 to 14 in the same quarter of 2023 core inflation in japanâs capital accelerated for a third straight month in july but an index gauging demanddriven price growth slowed tokyos core cpi which excludes volatile fresh food costs rose 22 in july from 21 in june but with energy costs stripped away it slowed to 15 from the previous month to 18 well that could complicate how soon the bank of japan decides to raise rates policymakers meet for two days next week as well as debating whether to increase rates theyll also be laying out details on how the boj will taper its huge bond purchases boj governor kazuo ueda has said the central bank will hike rates from current nearzero levels if it becomes more convinced that underlying inflation stays at around 2 in the coming years as it projects according to lseg estimates the rate futures market has priced in a 672 chance that rates will rise by 10 basis points up from a 40 chance earlier in the week one strategist we spoke to noticed a significant move by the markets on thursday
markets have been starting to up expectations or reprice the backdrop for next weeks boj meeting so at one stage earlier in todays session we had almost 9 basis points of tightening price for next week so combination of those factors have really encouraged a significant risk reversal and accordingly those risk barometer trades including majority of those which are short of yen have been unwound quite aggressively
its a busy week coming up on the corporate earnings front especially in japan with the likes of yamaha and japan airlines reporting perhaps the highlight will be on thursday when car giant toyota releases its first quarter results for 2025 today it was reported in the nikkei that it is going to set up a new ev battery plant in kyushu and thats it from your asia markets briefingc copyright thomson reuters 2024 click for restrictions  httpaboutreuterscomfulllegalasp",2024-07-26,Toyota,social

"fitch ratingsjakarta25 july 2024
fitch ratings indonesia has affirmed pt toyota astra financial services taf national longterm rating at aaaidn and national shortterm rating at f1idn the outlook on the national longterm rating is stable the ratings on tafs senior unsecured bonds and bond programme have also been affirmed at aaaidnaaa national longterm ratings denote the highest rating assigned by the agency in its national rating scale for that country this rating is assigned to issuers or obligations with the lowest expectation of default risk relative to all other issuers or obligations in the same country or monetary unionf1 national shortterm ratings indicate the strongest capacity for timely payment of financial commitments relative to other issuers or obligations in the same country under the agencys national rating scale this rating is assigned to the lowest default risk relative to others in the same country or monetary union where the liquidity profile is particularly strong a  is added to the assigned rating
key rating drivers
shareholder support anchors rating tafs national ratings are underpinned by our expectation of extraordinary support from its higherrated ultimate shareholder toyota motor corporation tmc astable if required this stems from our view of tmcs strong ability and propensity to support taf based on tmcs high credit rating and tafs strong synergies with tmcconsiderable ability to support we believe tmc has a strong ability to support taf due to tafs small size compared with the group tafs total assets accounted for only 04 of the groups consolidated assets at end2023 tmc owns 50 of taf while pt astra international tbk an indonesian conglomerate that distributes toyotas vehicles in indonesia among its numerous business interests holds the remaining stakeimportant market toshareholder our assessment of tmcs propensity to support taf considers tafs role as a captive financier for toyotagroup vehicles in indonesia it also reflects the indonesian markets position and importance as tmcs fourthlargest market globally taf finances a significant proportion of tmcs sales in indonesia and thus plays a synergistic role in maintaining toyotas leadership in indonesias automotive industryour support assessment also considers the potential high reputational damage for tmc if taf were to default given their shared branding and tafs extensive relationships with japanese banksfocus on captive brands taf predominantly finances sales of new toyota and daihatsu cars as well as lexus on a much smaller scale toyota and daihatsu are the largest car brands in indonesia with over 50 combined industry market share by unit of sales in 2023 tafs contribution to the total unit sales of these brands has continued to increase in recent yearsmodest standalone profile tafs standalone profile is not a key rating driver and fitch estimates it is lower than the supportdriven rating the standalone profile is constrained by indonesias developing operating environment as well as tafs monoline business model modest profitability and aboveindustry leverage this is balanced by tafs lowerrisk portfolio relative to its peers as evident from its consistently better asset quality compared with that of the industry
rating sensitivities factors that could individually or collectively lead to negative rating actiondowngrade
tafs rating is sensitive to fitchs assessment of tmcs ability to support taf as the rating is anchored by the shareholders rating however tafs national ratings would be resilient to a downgrade of up to three notches in tmcs longterm issuer default ratinga perceived material decline in tmcs propensity to provide support would be negative for the rating this could arise from a reduction in tmcs ownership that results in the automaker becoming a minority shareholder in taf or a deviation in tafs strategy of supporting the parents car sales in indonesia a downgrade could also be triggered by weakened synergies between taf and tmc however we do not expect such changes in the near to medium term
factors that could individually or collectively lead to positive rating actionupgrade
there is no upside to the national ratings as they are already at the top of the scale
debt and other instrument ratings key rating drivers
the ratings on the senior unsecured bonds are aligned with tafs national longterm rating in accordance with fitchs nonbank financial institutions rating criteria this is because they represent direct unconditional unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the issuer and rank equally with all its other senior unsecured obligations
debt and other instrument ratings rating sensitivities
any change in tafs national longterm rating would lead to a corresponding action on the debt ratings
references for substantially material source cited as key driver of rating the principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the applicable criteria public ratings with credit linkage to other ratings
tafs ratings are credit linked to tmcs longterm issuer default rating based on our expectation of extraordinary support

charge their vehicles battery but also send power back to the local energy grid v2g technology has the potential to support and provide benefits to customers through improved energy reliability and resilience the integration of renewables and the possibility of reduced electricity coststhis collaboration aims to understand the needs of ev owners through their charging habits and vehicle usage which will be crucial in driving widespread adoption of v2g technology nearly 80 percent of owners currently charge their evs at home overnight when demand for energy is lower with bidirectional capability these vehicles could send power back to the local energy grid during peak demand hours or at other critical times such as severe weather  bidirectional charging is a great way for customers to leverage their electric vehicles in a way that supports the grids and their home electricity ecosystem said christopher yang group vice president toyota ev charging solutions working with pepco will help us understand charging and discharging usecases which will ultimately benefit our customers and help utility providers better understand grid demandsmaryland is one of the fastest growing ev markets in the nation and is targeting to have 300000 evs on the road by 2025 pepco is helping maryland lead this charge by installing 250 ev chargers across montgomery and prince georges counties in april maryland also became the first state to pass vehicletogrid legislation when it passed hb 1256 – the distributed renewable integration and vehicle electrification drive act – that requires utilities to develop interconnection processes for bidirectional chargerspepco is leading the energy transformation in the communities we serve by embracing technology that is helping to drive the clean energy transition said tyler anthony president and ceo of pepco holdings v2g is designed to connect with the local energy grid and is part of our roadmap to ensure a successful and equitable energy transition this collaboration with toyota allows us to better understand v2g technology and its impact on the grid our customers and overall service reliability as we work together toward a more sustainable and resilient future for the communities we servethe v2g research will take place at pepcos watershed sustainability center located at the companys rockville service center in montgomery county maryland using a bidirectional charger pepco will lead the effort to design and evaluate a variety of ev charging and discharging usecases that can potentially provide grid and customer benefits the demonstration project will also assist pepco in understanding the infrastructure needed to enable the rapid growth of ev charging infrastructure and the nuances of interconnecting large numbers of v2g assets to the grid to better prepare the utility to implement requirements of the drive act and support customer adoption of this technology currently toyota offers two massmarket bevs in the us and canada – the toyota bz4x and lexus rz toyota recently announced plans for two allnew threerow bev suvs that will be assembled at toyota motor manufacturing

unmistakable futuristic hum from passing vehicles on the road signals a new era in transportation and mobility the automotive industry is transforming with new ownership models cuttingedge connectivity and innovative advanced electrified powertrainsbut with change comes questions why are automakers focusing so much on electrified powertrains what does this shift marked by the futuristic hum really mean for consumers and is this transformation really necessaryat the core it comes down to carbon dioxide co2 emissions co2 is essential to life on earth but too much poses a threat when in balance co2 helps keep planet earth warm enough to sustain life however an imbalance can lead to a much warmer average temperature which can lead to bringing forward the predicted results of climate changebut where does this excess co2 come from natural sources make up the majority of co2 released into the atmosphere oceans animal and plant respiration organic matter decomposition forest fires and emissions from volcanic eruptionsanother contributor to co2 emissions is human activity including power generation industrial sources chemical production agricultural practices and transportation of all sectors transportation accounts for the largest percentage of greenhouse gas ghg emissions in the united states coming in at 28 between 1990 and 2021r ghg emissions within the transportation sector including carbon dioxide increased more than any other humanbased activity science has shown that co2 is a contributing factor to climate change and as such efforts by governments companies and individuals to reduce or eliminate co2 emissions are gaining momentum after all co2 emissions can remain in the atmosphere for hundreds of years and the impact of emissions in one region can be felt globallyas automobile tailpipes are prevalently visible by so many people each day transportation especially the automotive industry has become a focal point fortunately various solutions are being deployed regulations incentives innovative products technologies and services are converging to combat co2to explore these critical topics a compelling threepart video series driving decarbonization in america has been produced by bader media group funded by toyota hosted by ross butler with field reporting from neka zang and ariana cohen the series immerses viewers in the world of co2 emissions and what is being done in the automotive industry examining what carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases are the series delves into the relentless drive to reduce or eliminate co2 from new vehicles by exploring the various vehicle types powertrains and technologies that have shaped – and continue to shape – the industry landscape viewers are taken on a dynamic journey that spans past present and future innovations in sustainable mobilityproviding a rare glimpse into the automakers perspective the series hosts speak with the worlds largest manufacturer toyota providing an indepth look at their

portfolio of low and zeroemission vehicles are currently available and are helping reduce co2 emissions today hybrid plugin hybrid fuel cell and battery electric vehicles will be discussed shedding light on how choices can help consumers find a way to reduce their carbon dioxide emissionsautomotive batteriesthe push towards electrification means more automotive batteries while having more battery electric vehicles on the road may mean less tailpipeemissions what about other sources of emissions are we just shifting co2 emissions from the tailpipe to somewhere else innovations in battery recycling and ways to optimize supply chain logistics will be key to this growing areaexisting vehiclesthere is a significant emphasis on new vehicles and their emissions but what about the vehicles that are not electrified even with the most optimistic projections indicating that 50 or more of new vehicle sales in the united states will be battery electric by 2032 the fact remains that a large portion of vehicles on the road will still have internal combustion engines meaning they may still emit carbon dioxide if reducing carbon is so important and a priority is there a solution that can help reduce co2 emissions from these and other legacy vehiclesutilityenergy systemselectric vehicles also bring with them the possibility of bidirectional charging where electricity can be taken off the grid to charge the batteries but also flow the other way but when is the best time to charge and is the electricity being used coming from renewable energy sources how can vehicles

is critical to our mission of accelerating the mass adoption of evs said dennis kish president of evgo we are proud to partner with toyota to build new fast charging resources that will support the equitable distribution of charging infrastructure in the golden statethe cities receiving dc fast chargers were chosen using the calenviroscreen tool and based on certain criteria such as resident income levels demographics air quality levels and areas that have or are expected to have meaningful ev penetration baldwin park and sacramento are both great examples of areas that are poised to see rapid ev growth in the future these two environmental justice communities would benefit from the addition of more dc fast charging stations in strategic locations to serve the local population and

 fuelcell energy and toyota motor north america celebrate
 launch of worlds first trigen production system at the
 port of long beach

st

   fuelcell energys trigen technology produces three products renewable
electricity renewable hydrogen and usable water

   marks toyotas first port vehicle processing facility in the world to
be powered by onsitegenerated 100 percent renewable electricity

   both lightduty and class 8 heavyduty fuel cell electric vehicles have
been fueled using trigen generated renewable hydrogen

et

     fuelcell energy inc and toyota motor north america inc toyotaare
celebrating the grand opening ofthe firstofitskind trigen systemat
the port of long beach california today trigen uses biogas to produce
renewable electricity renewable hydrogen and usable water and was built
to support the vehicle processing and distribution center for toyota
logistics services tls at long beach toyotas largest north american
vehicle processing facility that receives approximately 200000 new toyota
and lexus vehicles annually

     the goal of our collaboration with fuelcell energy was to find
sustainable solutions for the tls vehicle processing facility here at the
port of long beach as part of our goal to remove carbon dioxide emissions
from our operations said group vice president of sustainability and
regulatory affairs at toyota tom stricker this groundbreaking facility
shows that there are ways to reduce our emissions and burden on natural
resources with scalable technology based on hydrogen

     thanks to fuelcell energys trigen platform tls long beach is
toyotas first port vehicle processing facility powered by 100 percent
onsite generated renewable electricity fuelcell energys innovative fuel
cell technology uses an electrochemical process that converts directed
renewable biogas into electricity hydrogen and usable water with a highly
efficient combustionfree process that emits virtually no air pollutants

     trigen demonstrates that hydrogenbased energy can benefit
businesses deliver zeroemission transportation for light and heavyduty
vehicles support improved air quality in local communities reduce water
usage and deliver immediate and longterm benefits to the environment
fuelcell energy ceo and president jason few said as a company we are
living our purpose when we enable visionary customers like toyota to
decarbonize their operations and harness the energy solutions offered by
hydrogenall while leaving communities with cleaner air and easing the
strain on power grids and water supplies

     trigen produces 23megawatts of renewable electricity part of which
will be utilized by tls long beach to support its operations at the port
excess electricity is delivered to the local utility southern california
edison under the california bioenergy market adjustment tariff biomat
program adding a renewable resilient and affordable baseload electric
generation resource to the electric grid

     trigen can also produce up to 1200 kgday of hydrogen for the
fueling needs of toyotas incoming lightduty fuel cell electric vehicle
fcev mirai while also supplying hydrogen to the adjacent heavyduty
hydrogen refueling station to support tls logistics and drayage operations
at the port as of january 1 2024 californias advanced clean fleet
regulation will only allow zeroemission trucks to newly register as
drayage trucks by 2035 all drayage trucks will be required to be
zeroemission the trigen platform supports fcev class 8 trucks today and
is there to support ongoing migration to zero emission trucks between now
and 2035 hydrogen production can be ramped up and down based on
demandsince completing construction last year in january of this year
toyota used the renewable hydrogen produced at trigen to fill the first
toyota mirai vehicles at tls and in april the first heavyduty fcev
kenworth t680 class 8 truck was filled at the adjacent shell hd filling
station using trigenproduced renewable hydrogen

     the water byproduct of hydrogen generation can produce up to 1400
gallons of usable water per day which is being repurposed for tlscar wash
operations for vehicles that come into port before customer delivery this
helps reduce the demand on the constrained local water supplies by
approximately half a million gallons per year

     supporting port of long beach initiatives

     by supporting tls operations at the port of long beach trigen is
expected to help reduce more than 9000 tons of co emissions from the power
grid each year this supports both toyota logistics services carbon
reduction goals as well as the port of long beachs goals as a leader in
innovative solutions to reducing carbon emissions

     the dawn of the renewable hydrogen era is upon us thanks to our
collaboration with toyota andfuelcell energy and their innovative trigen
system said port of long beach ceo mario cordero the green power
generated by the trigen system and similar projects is part of our
multilayered strategy to fuel our goal to become the worlds first
zeroemissions port

     trigen will also help avoid more than six tons of grid nox emissions
which are harmful to both people and the environment today using
hydrogenpowered fuel cell class 8 trucks in port operations has the
potential to reduce diesel consumption by more than 420000 gallons per
year

     fuelcell energy and toyotas collaborative effort signifies
technological innovation and also positions long beach at the forefront of
global leadership in renewable energy solutions said long beach mayor
rex richardson this transformative initiative solidifies our citys
status as a trailblazer in green initiatives and shows our dedication to a
cleaner more sustainable future for our community and beyond

approximately 200000 new toyota and lexus vehicles annuallythe goal of our collaboration with fuelcell energy was to find sustainable solutions for the tls vehicle processing facility here at the port of long beach as part of our goal to remove carbon dioxide emissions from our operations said group vice president of sustainability and regulatory affairs at toyota tom stricker this groundbreaking facility shows that there are ways to reduce our emissions and burden on natural resources with scalable technology based on hydrogenthanks to fuelcell energys trigen platform tls long beach is toyotas first port vehicle processing facility powered by 100 percent onsite generated renewable electricity fuelcell energys innovative fuel cell technology uses an electrochemical process that converts directed renewable biogas into electricity hydrogen and usable water with a highly efficient combustionfree process that emits virtually no air pollutantstrigen demonstrates that hydrogenbased energy can benefit businesses deliver zeroemission transportation for light and heavyduty vehicles support improved air quality in local communities reduce water usage and deliver immediate and longterm benefits to the environment fuelcell energy ceo and president jason few said as a company we are living our purpose when we enable visionary customers like toyota to decarbonize their operations and harness the energy solutions offered by hydrogen—all while leaving communities with cleaner air and easing the strain on power grids and water suppliestrigen produces 23megawatts of renewable electricity part of which will be utilized by tls long beach to support its operations at the port excess electricity is delivered to the local utility southern california edison under the california bioenergy market adjustment tariff biomat program adding a renewable resilient and affordable baseload electric generation resource to the electric gridtrigen can also produce up to 1200 kgday of hydrogen for the fueling needs of toyotas incoming lightduty fuel cell electric vehicle fcev mirai while also supplying hydrogen to the adjacent heavyduty hydrogen refueling station to support tls logistics and drayage operations at the port as of january 1 2024 californias advanced clean fleet regulation will only allow zeroemission trucks to newly register as drayage trucks by 2035 all drayage trucks will be required to be zeroemission the trigen platform supports fcev class 8 trucks today and is there to support ongoing migration to zero emission trucks between now and 2035 hydrogen production can be ramped up and down based on demand since completing construction last year in january of this year toyota used the renewable hydrogen produced at trigen to fill the first toyota mirai vehicles at tls and in april the first heavyduty fcev kenworth t680 class 8 truck was filled at the adjacent shell hd filling station using trigenproduced renewable hydrogenthe water byproduct of hydrogen generation can produce up to 1400 gallons of usable water per day which is being repurposed for tls car wash operations for vehicles that come into port before customer delivery this helps reduce the demand on the constrained local water supplies by approximately half a million gallons per yearsupporting port of long beach initiativesby supporting tls operations at the port of long beach trigen is expected to help reduce more than 9000 tons of co₂ emissions from the power grid each year this supports both toyota logistics services carbon reduction goals as well as the port of long beachs goals as a leader in innovative solutions to reducing carbon emissionsthe dawn of the renewable hydrogen era is upon us thanks to our collaboration with toyota and fuelcell energy and their innovative trigen system said port of long beach ceo mario cordero the green power generated by the trigen system and similar projects is part of our multilayered strategy to fuel our goal to become the worlds first zeroemissions porttrigen will also help avoid more than six tons of grid nox emissions which are harmful to both people and the environment today using hydrogenpowered fuel cell class 8 trucks in port operations has the potential to reduce diesel consumption by more than 420000 gallons per yearfuelcell energy and toyotas collaborative effort signifies technological

video transcript
elections in major markets raise questions for european investors welcome to market insight i am thomas warner frances leftwing alliance became the largest group in a hung parliament over the weekend just days after a landslide win for britains labour party britains new pm and his ministers have been out and about ever since thursday laying out their plans for the next five years but the situation in france looks far more complicated with me to help make sense of its all is russ mould he is the investment director at aj bell and a very warm welcome to you russ very good of you to give up your time to come and talk to us today now turning to france we have potentially got weeks of parliamentary horsetrading to come and so far there does seem to be little sign of any concern at all in the equity markets is it the calm before the storm do you think russ
that is a good question right equity markets were braced for a very difficult result and they certainly got that last weekend and i think the summary for the results of the second round is not ideal could have been worse worst news probably already priced in so i think that is why the equity market is taking it quite calmly the euro was currently holding firm and although the cost of french government borrowing is above average relative to the german government cost of borrowing it is within historic limits and actually not moving up to sharply today so again currency bond stock markets all relatively calm and i think again the result could have been worse but much works still to be done we have a very difficult negotiation for a coalition to come up frances debts are way above the levels that are acceptable to the maastricht treaty and the new government itself has got some very aggressive spending or the biggest party has got aggressive spending plans of its own so much work still to be done
let us look at the uk now the new finance minister rachel reeves was laying out plans this morning to kick start homebuilding once again though russ the stock markets did not really react why was that do you think
the homebuilders have actually had a very good run in the weeks leading up to the election again in the view that labour would win and win handily which they did and that some supplyside reforms involving planning and housing and renewables and infrastructure would be big forefronts of any labour economic plan so again largely expected there so the builders having already had a good run saying well fine we kind of know all this i think rachel reeves the new finance minister is now saying we are going to carry out thorough treasury spending review we are going to get the office for budget responsibility prepare some new economic growth forecasts and we will prioritize growth when we come to the autumn budget i think now all eyes will move onto that financial statement when it comes
you have obviously been speaking to people all morning about this particularly this address from rachel reeves so what sort of reaction have you been getting from people out there
again it is a very similar reaction to the french situation i guess there is probably more comfort in that labour does have a thumping majority and will be easily able to pass any legislation it chooses to and also the lessons of trussonomics and the accident that befell the british economy under the conservative government in 2022 is being seen by financial market participants as a warning sign that labour will not do anything too aggressive on tax and spending certainly at least initially equally markets do seem quite pleased with the labour partys focus on growth because that is what is really needed to help the uk shake off its debt is growth and there is not an awful lot of fiscal room for maneuver simple because debt to gdp is so high so it is a fitting that their policy seem sensible and prudent and as long as if there is extra borrowing it is for productive investment rather than just welfare payments markets for the moment at least would be relatively calm
well there has been one stock that has been lighting up the ftse today russ that is britvic it has agreed to a takeover from carlsberg at the third time of asking who has got the better end of that deal do you think
yes it is interesting normally you see one share price go up and one share price go down when a big deal is done on the grounds that somebody is getting a good price and somebody is getting a bad one both shares are up today britvic to near the big price level to suggest that investors now feel confident it will go through i think carlsberg investors were initially quite nervous but now that pepsico was giving its blessing for the deal because britvic is a big bottling agent for them i think that has eased one major obstacle and they have not raised their bid price too much for their initial offers so maybe both sides will win and carlsberg looking to diversify maybe appeal to younger generation who do not drink quite so much beer and drink softer drinks instead
well there is one country in europe where they will never give up their love of beer i think that is germany and we have had a big story over there today is the online takeaway firm delivery hero russ down heavily after revealing that it might be facing a eur400 million fine for antitrust violations what is your understanding of they are in trouble for and how material of a fine do you think that might be for them
yes i mean management have already put away a provision of eur189 million because this investigation by the european commission has been running since 2022 when their offices were raided the company has been accused of anticompetitive practice information sharing for example with rivals which may i guess they are able to decide who addresses which markets how much they charge i guess the potential implications of that the fine of more than eur400 million which management is now expecting well ironically delivery hero is expected get into profit for the first time this year at the operating level and that is at around eur200 million level so more than double they made and never profit it is not an insignificant sum it is quite a big hit and that is why the shares are down to almost fresh multiyear lows today as a result on the frankfurt exchange
just finally russ i am going to ask you about ocado they have signed a deal and have announced today they are going to be building a third robotic warehouse over in japan they obviously dropped out of the ftse 100 a couple of weeks ago shares are down by half since january what do you make of tim steiners efforts to turn things around over there
i mean the shares reached a sevenyear low and so the issue whether ocado is on the right track and how much mr steiner is paid they are always going to be bubbling around there but at least this is some good news for the company with this third warehousing facility in japan after north american partner sobeys in canada declined to add to i think a fifth facility in its rollup and made sure that it was no longer exclusive so ocado could perhaps look for other partners in the usa and canada so the model for ocado it is still losing money in food delivery with the joint venture with marks amp spencer here in the uk it is trying to turn itself into this technology software company and investors have been very very patient and waiting for that to turn into a profit the more partners they have the more warehouses roll out the better but it still yet to prove itself and that is why their shares have been finding it pretty tough going this year
investment director at aj bell russ mould many thanks indeed for your thoughts today and that is market insightc copyright thomson reuters 2024 click for restrictions  httpaboutreuterscomfulllegalasp",2024-07-08,Marks & Spencer,social

archie normans first attempt a year ago to reinvent the annual shareholder meeting for the digital age suffered from an enormous error in designing the event as digitalonly – in other words in telling shareholders not to turn up in person and to tune in online instead – the chair of marks amp spencer abused the wellestablished principle that even small investors in a listed company must have the right once a year to buttonhole the bosses in the flesh directors cannot expect to live virtually the pandemic is overhis second effort on tuesday was vastly improved because it was a genuine hybrid event shareholders were free to ignore mampss odd advice that they would get the best experience by joining online and 100plus individuals were in the room at the companys headquarters in paddington west london the point lets hope has been made leave it up to the punters to decide how they wish to participate which is how mamps behaves in its day job as an omnichannel retaileryet normans push for greater digital access is correct at its core to catch the attention of private shareholders – folk who everybody says are vital to the task of reviving interest in public markets – there must be a video component in the age of zoom and teams not everybody lives in london where most meetings happen mampss online audience was many times greater than the one in the buildingone cannot say the investors were treated to scintillating content of course the main minirevelation in the qampa was that the company had an astonishing 50000 exemployees with discount cards entitling them to 20off for life before the chief executive stuart machin decided the policy was absurdly generous and moved the qualifying employment period from 10 years to 25but shareholders did get to press norman on his cautious approach to dividends which seemed to be their main grumble and he and machin were obliged to explain why mamps wont guarantee to pay its contractors as opposed to its staff the real living wage that is worth doing in a public forumbroadly speaking the hybrid format worked it is possible to quibble with the use of a shareholder advocate in the form of broadcaster anita anand to select the online questions but a managed process does allow more ground to be covered and an outsider is arguably better placed than the chair to cut off verbose questioners or the offensive variety recall the appalling misogynistic comments at avivas meeting a couple of years agoother companies should take note attendances at annual company meetings have been in decline for years most boardrooms give the impression they wish the events didnt exist whether out of fear of protesters or because they regard small investors as irrelevant norman is at least trying to stir interest and stand up for the small shareholder which should be applaudeda few bigname investment trusts such as fundsmith and scottish mortgage attract healthy audiences of interested investors who ask sharp questions there is no reason why regular companies shouldnt aim for the same thing it would show a certain basic acceptance of the advantage of openness more shareholders should attend whether virtually or in person more companies should make it worth their whilecopyright c 2024 theguardiancomnonsyndicated,2024-07-02,Marks & Spencer,social

summer scents we typically think of citrus and aqua notes but theres a fine line between smelling like the algarve and smelling like the bathroomif you want your summer perfume to transport you look no further than jo loves new scent with love from positano not going abroad this summer jo malones wood sage and sea salt will blow the cobwebs off you in the same way those cornish cliffs willas well as new places these summer scents can also convey nostalgia and nothing is more nostalgic than the smell of nivea sun cream  which has been bottled up into a perfumealongside your favourites ive also

scents to spritz this seasonhow i tested the best summer perfumesas fresh scents arent known for their lasting power i wore each of these perfumes for an entire day spraying both my skin and my

carpenter has launched a new perfume – could it be the scent of the summerchanels new perfume is inspired by the cosmos and im starryeyed for itds amp durga debaserby far the most unique summer perfume on this list and one that will make you want to explore the rest of the ds amp durga line described as hot humid and sexy the debaser perfume was inspired by nostalgic road trip summers around the new england coast while listening to the pixies on the car stereo while my summers in croydon recreation grounds cant relate they can appreciate this fig scent on first spritz the debaser perfume immediately takes you outside with its freshness – in a green not citrus way its weird to say i know but it almost smells wet the sexiness comes when the fig takes over followed by soft blonde woods and muskit evokes that endless summer feeling warm nights that mean you can stay outside for hours slightly sweaty skin in a hot way and maybe even the hope of a cliched fling this deserves five stars for taking a completely different approach but still capturing all the summer feels not to mention is a fresh scent that lasts on the skin to the point i could still smell it on my tshirt the next daybuy now £15500 spacenkcomnivea sun eau de toilettenivea sun may be the cheapest on the list by far but its the one that truly does capture the real essence of summer to me its as much a perfume as it is a mood enhancer and come summer i spray it with the same enthusiasm as i do my nephews nerf super soaker water gunthe smell is literally niveas signature sun cream which is as much the scent of summer as it is a nostalgia weapon for me visceral memories of carefree childhood holidays come flooding back along with images of my nan in her apartment in malagato me this perfume does get five out of five but to you i cant score it that way because the simple fact is it does not last there is zero staying power here beyond an hours wear which for any other £40 perfume would be a complete fail thankfully for nivea however the joy of spritzing this never gets oldbuy now £3700 amazoncoukjo malone wood sage amp sea saltthis is somewhat of a rediscovery for me this summer and now were reacquainted im telling you this should be a staple for everyone having a uk staycationperfume descriptions are often ridiculous but jo malone perfectly captured wood sage and sea salt breathe in the bracing air of the british coast this is the ice bath of summer scents and i love to liberally spray it on those mornings when the sun is streaming in and youre eager to get out into the great outdoorsin my opinion this is the most genderneutral scent on this list it holds up a good few hours – i dont mind losing a few for that freshness i do however hate that it makes me rage for failing once again to book a summer cornwall breakbuy now £11800 lookfantasticcombvlgari allegra chill and sole eau de perfumeif the sparkle of the sun shining on the turquoise waters of the mediterranean had a smell this perfume would surely be it newly released in 2024 bvlgaris allegra chill and sole is so fresh that one spray makes you instantly feel lighter brighter and airer even better its a crispness that lingers which is rare for summer scentsthe blend of neroli lemon orange blossom and petitgrain makes it smell as pretty as the pink and blue bottle looks and for such a fresh scent its fairly strong two squirts maximum for me like all summer perfumes it does lack lasting power but it will see you through the day before requiring a topup for your evening activitiesbuy now £14900 harrodscomdedcool red dakotabefore spacenk got its hands on it and we could finally buy the brand in the uk i walked the streets of new york and los angeles desperately hunting down dedcools iconic xtra milk skin scent on one of my failed attempts i found the hand wash in red dakota instead and honestly i dont ever want to buy another brand again thankfully red dakota also comes in perfume form so i no longer have to sniff my hands to get my fixout of all the scents on this list this to me is the warmest and most comforting thats because of the middle woody amber notes with the hit of summer coming before thanks to clementine and gardenia i dont want a summer of adventure when i spray this i want a summer of all the best parts with none of the scariness of change that september brings im talking about the holiday with your best friends where you barely leave the villa the nights where you stay up in the garden talking till the early hours and the days where every dinner is an impromptu barbecuebuy now £7100 spacenkcomby kilian sunkissed goddessby kilian is the brand best known for being rihannas favourite perfume and i think you wont be disappointed with sunkissed goddess its exactly how i imagine a very sexy beautifully dressed woman with a lot of disposable income would smell picture amal clooney getting ready for dinner in her lake como villathis is a more grownup summer scent than bvlgaris chill and sole perfume despite the creamy coconut and vanilla thats because it dries down to an almost powdery finish which cuts through the sweetness to me this is a real neck nuzzler of a scent whether youre wearing it or someone else you keep wanting to go back for a whiff luckily then this is another one on the list that has good staying powerbuy now £22000 cultbeautycoukaerin mediterranean honeysuckleanother scent inspired by the mediterranean but somehow smells completely different i dont actually get that vibe from it not that im complaining because i havent stopped thinking about this perfume since i first sprayed itits described as a floral citrus but its the latter part im missing instead to me it smells like a bright clean fresh summer scent think washing thats dried on the line for oncewhile the grapefruit bergamot and orange dont really come through the honeysuckle lily of the valley and gardenia do and thats coming from someone who is not a fan of floral scents there is one downside like many of these fresh scents it only lingers for a few hoursbuy now £7875 lookfantasticcomvyrao sun raeif you like a little more zing in your summer scent and by zing i mean spice this is the one to pick id describe vyraos sun rae by saying its the perfume i can picture phoebe from friends wearing when new york hits that summer heat lemon gives it an initial fresh summery scent but theres also turmeric root ginger black pepper and cardamom its different from other citrus scents in a spicy wayas the spiciness wears away youre left with sandalwood amber and musk all giving an enveloping beautiful warm skin smell if youre tired of generic summer scents or want a twist on the classic citrus this is one to add to your listbuy now £13500 spacenkcomthe verdict summer perfumestheres so much more to summer scents than those generic noughties coconut ones i grew up with – i love how brands such as dedcool and ds amp durga are shaking up the genre while all these scents require at least an evening topup some including nivea  disappear far quicker than others however the feeling just one spritz gives me makes it worth the money bear

"fitch ratingslondon29 july 2024
fitch ratings has assigned ocado group plcs ocado prospective gbp350 million 2029 notes an expected senior unsecured instrument rating of bexp with a recovery rating of rr4 this is aligned with ocados longterm issuer default rating idr of b which has a stable outlook and existing unsecured instrument ratingocado plc is planning to raise gbp250 million convertibles notes and gbp350 million unsecured notes the proceeds of the new notes will be used towards part prepayment of its existing debt in particular via tender offers for part of the gbp600 million convertible loan due in december 2025 and the gbp500 million unsecured notes due in october 2026 we assume that any cash remaining unused in the tender offers will remain earmarked for debt repayment subsequently the new notes will rank equally and share guarantors with ocados existing unsecured notes and convertible bonds the assignment of the final rating is conditional on completion and final terms and conditions being in line with information receivedwe view positively ocados proactive attempt to address its refinancing risk which would otherwise weigh negatively on the rating 1215 months ahead of the debt maturity ocado plans to also extend its gbp300 million undrawn revolving credit facility rcf maturing in june 2025 as part of the refinancing exerciseocados rating reflects its technological capabilities to help drive online grocery profitability as well as high execution risk to reach scale and profitability based on our estimates if all debt is refinanced ocado may maintain sufficient cash to fund its capex in fy24fy26 yearend november material debt repayment from cash would however reduce available liquidity to fund capex which would be negative for the rating
key rating drivers
proactivelyaddressing refinancing risk we view positively ocados proactive attempt to address upcoming debt maturities via todays planned debt issue we assume voluntary open market repurchases of its existing debt with no coercion in which case debt buybacks with slight discount would not be deemed distressed debt exchange the debt will be refinanced at materially higher interest rates than paid currently 0875 coupon for the convertible inability to refinance or refinancing at materially higher rates than assumed would be negative for the ratingimproving positivefy24ebitda we forecast ebitda post rents of around gbp60 million in fy24 before it rises to gbp185 million by fy26 this compares with gbp14 million in fy23 after a period of losses for the last nine years however following the groups update in midjuly our forecast now excludes one new cfc due to its customer canadian food retailer sobeys pausing after mutual agreementampnbsp their new opening and reflects improved profitability from customer kroger us food retailer rolling out new technology in combination with additional capex to retrofit its cfc networkhigh execution risk we see high execution risk in ocados business plan to ramp up existing cfcs roll out new cfcs and deliver efficiencies to drive earnings growth profit growth plans rest on the addition of eight new international cfcs over the next three years and on reaching full cfc capacity by the fifth or six year of going live customers cfcs have demonstrated slowerthananticipated rampup due to weaker online grocery demand and in some cases operational challenges ocado is helping its clients via its partner success programme but the results of these efforts are not fully in ocados controlsatisfactory liquidity ocado had sufficient cash balances of around gbp800 million at fye23 to fund fy24 and fy25 capex but cash will be eroded by fye28 material debt reduction with cash would further reduce available liquidity and could be negative for the rating cash will be supported by nearly gbp160ampnbspmillion cash inflows to be received from its autostore settlement over fy24fy25 we also assume that its gbp300 million rcf currently undrawn remains fully available and will be extended to support liquidity as part of refinancing exercisescale and cost control we believe the business should generate adequate profit margins once it reaches scale with ebitda margins improving to 165 by fy27 our forecast incorporates lower direct operating costs including technology and support costs ocado has stated it targets to reduce annual cash technology costs to gbp240 million from gbp292 million in fy23 and its cash support costs to gbp150 million gbp191 million in fy23 in the medium termnegative fcf we project an average of gbp300 million annual negative free cash flow fcf over fy24fy26 ocado has stated that it expects to turn fcfpositive in 2hfy26 we believe that ocado has further scope to lower its technology and support costs we also understand from management that the group does not intend to raise more debt beyond its refinancing needs and plans to fund growth capex from internally generated cash in the medium termfurther refinancing needed our rating case projects that despite the transaction ocado will need to refinance the majority of its unsecured notes in 2026 and a second gbp350 million convertible note due in january 2027 as well as raise some new funding we also see a risk that fcf may remain negative in fy27 after it has deployed its current cash balanceskey internationalcustomers kroger is a key customer with eight live cfcs that have been slower to ramp up against the original plan of 20 cfcs which ocado is assisting via its partner success programme recently kroger has demonstrated confidence in ocados solution by ordering ocados latest technology to retrofit its existing cfcs sobeys has three live cfcs while the fourth one has been paused opening of two new cfcs for australian food retailer coles is expected shortly after a delay from fy23 alcampo will also launch its madrid cfc this weekoverall at fye23 ocados technology was employed at 14 international cfcs by five customers with an average of 314 modules in each cfc which have gradually gone live since fy20incremental oia ocado plans to grow its intelligent automation oia segment in a capitallight way having one contracted partner us healthcare distributor mckesson corporation to go live in fy25 we incorporate only limited profit and cash contribution but understand from management that ocado has a strong oia pipeline and growth ambitions for this segmentlow margin forjvorl ocado retail limited orl which we deconsolidate in our projections reported only a small profit in fy23 which was in line with its guidance this was due to higher fees and support costs despite growth in sales stable gross profit margin and efficiencies in fulfilment and delivery costs in 1hfy24 orl reported continued positive momentum in active customer numbers average orders per week and in basket value driving growth in revenues and ebitda nevertheless orl guides to a fairly low 25 adjusted ebitda margin before gbp33 million payment for unused capacity at hatfield cfc to ocado solutions for fy24importance of profitable online channel ocados technology enables efficiency and profitability in the online channel which is critical to retailers we expect retail sales in the online channel to expand in the long term in turn this should continue driving demand for ocados solutions
derivation summary
fitch applies its business service navigator framework to ocado this reflects that the uk retail operations under 50owned orl are ringfenced with no direct recourse from ocados lenders and our view that the business risk profile of the solutions business will drive ocados credit quality in the long term due to its the accelerating growth and investmentsin comparison with irel bidco sarl ifco bstable which provides reusable packaging container solutions to the retail sector ocado is less established and has higher execution risk ifco is a global leader in a niche market and benefits from scale geographic diversification as well as longstanding customer relationships in a sector with good growth prospects ocado will have similar characteristics once its business reaches its targeted scale in addition to a contracted revenue base low customer churn and high switching costs a function of its bespoke technology this helps counterbalance some reliance on kroger as its key customer and partneronce it reaches scale ocado should demonstrate solid profitability for the rating with an ebitda margin trending towards 16 which is below the more established ifcos above 20 given their current excessive level leverage metrics are not a rating driver for ocado but our expectation of a progressive reduction to around 7x8x by fy26 supports the rating this level compares with lower expected leverage for ifco at below 60x which is better aligned with the b rating categorywe have also compared ocado with polygon group ab bnegative a market leader on the european property damage restoration industry both companies have comparable business profiles with leading market positions in their respective industries and similar scale ocado has better geographical diversification and expected revenue visibility than polygon which is exposed to the german market with shorterlength contracts this is offset by the higher execution risk of ocados businesspolygon had higher ebitda margin of around 60 in 2022 but we expect that ocados profitability will improve to 110 in fy25 as it continues to ramp up existing cfcs and drive efficiencies polygon had lower ebitda leverage at around 90x in 2022 than ocado due to lower operating profitability but is expected to recover to around 70x
key assumptions
fitchs key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer revenue for the technology solutions segment to grow to gbp630 million in fy26 as cfcs are ramped up and rolled out eight new cfcs and 46 new modules added in fy24fy26 revenues for uk logistics increasing towards gbp720 million by fy26 ebitdar for the technology solutions segment to rise to near gbp65 million in fy24 and gbp185ampnbspmillion in fy26 ebitdar for the uk logistics segment to gradually grow to around gbp35 million in fy27 from around gbp30ampnbspmillion in fy24 lease cost on average gbp30 million per year in fy24fy26 gross capex excluding orl averaging gbp430 million a year in fy24fy27 cash inflows of gbp100 million and gbp58 million in fy24 and fy25 respectively from autostore settlement no dividends from orl no mampampa no common dividend payments
recovery analysis
fitchs key recovery rating assumptionsthe recovery analysis assumes that ocado would be reorganised as a going concern gc in bankruptcy rather than liquidated fitch has assumed a 10 administrative claim and the value available to creditors consisting of the sum of ocado restricted groups enterprise value ev and 50 of orlocados gc ebitda is based on fy25 ebitda for the restricted group at around gbp105 million previously on fy24 expected ebitda of around gbp80 million capturing cfcs that are under construction now and to open shortly fitch expects gbp95 million gbp71 million previously of this would be available to creditors postrestructuring due to execution risks in the international technology segment while also recognising a more established uk businesswe have used an unchanged 60x evebitda multiple which is in line with business services companies distressed multiple but reflects the strong growth of ocados business and its market positionadditionally we attribute half of our estimated gbp06 billion gbp09 billion previously gc valuation of orl business to ocados cashflow waterfall we view that a default of orl would not be simultaneous and consequently base the jv valuation on an expected sustainable mediumterm ebitda of gbp75 million revised from gbp110 million and an 8x multiple which is not a distressed valuation the multiple is based on trading multiples for grocers and higher multiples for pure online retailers and technology companies any additional debt at the jv above the assumed gbp30 million rcf will affect the value attributed to itocados gbp300 million secured rcf ranks ahead of its other existing debt senior unsecured notes gbp500 million rank equally with its gbp950 million convertiblesthe outcome of the recovery analysis for senior unsecured notes is brr4 aligned with ocados longterm idr the waterfall analysis output percentage is 32 unchanged should additional debt ranking ahead or equally with unsecured notes be added to ocados capital structure this will push the recovery rating of the notes to rr5we expect the outcome of the recovery analysis once the new senior unsecured notes are issued to be brr4 which is aligned with ocados existing senior secured instrument rating this is based on the assumption that in the event that not all the gbp600m proceeds from the current transaction are utilized in the planned tender offers unused proceeds will remain earmarked for subsequent debt repayment of the current gbp1450m senior unsecured debt
rating sensitivities
factorsthat could individuallyorcollectively leadtopositive rating actionupgradefitch does not envisage a positive rating action during fy24fy28 due to execution risks associated with the transformation into a solutions and business service provider however over the long term evidence of greater maturity of the business with increasing scale and diversification and lower upfront capex would indicate successful execution of ocados growth strategy would be positive for the rating together with ebitda trending to gbp200 million sufficient positive fcf generation to fund growth capex ebitda interest coverage recovering towards 15x visibility of ebitda gross leverage trending below 65x on a sustained basisfactorsthat could individuallyorcollectively leadtonegative rating actiondowngrade inability to refinance 1215 months ahead of debt maturities or insufficient liquidity to fund at least two years of capex continued execution challenges such as further delays in rollout of new cfcs inability to scale up existing cfcs or deliver technology or support cost efficiencies leading to ebitda not reaching at least gbp50 million in fy24 and at least gbp100 million by fy25 and a faster cash burn than captured in our rating case readily available cash materially below gbp500 million at fye24
liquidity and debt structure
adequate cash to fund investments the restricted group ie excluding orl has an adequate but declining cash position comprising around gbp800 million cash and a fully undrawn gbp300 million rcf we expect this liquidity to support its fy24fy26 high capex we estimate available liquidity of gbp850ampnbspmillion at fye24approaching debt maturities ocados mediumterm liquidity profile is strongly dependent on its ability to timely address upcoming gbp600 million convertible notes due december 2025 and gbp500 million senior unsecured notes due october 2026 with external resources the rcf expires in june 2025 but has an option to extend by one year that we expect to be exercisedocado has demonstrated strong access to financial markets via capital raises including gbp500 million senior unsecured notes in september 2021 following a gbp350 million convertible bond due in january 2027 along with a gbp657 million new share placement in 2020

supplier for mamps via egg company bumble hole foodsshe was struggling to free herself from a hazardous slatted system with other birds already dead and hanging off tiers an ajp spokesperson saidthe

fails to shield these birds from suffering despite the organisations mission claiming to advocate for every kind of animalan mamps spokesperson said the footage shows unacceptable levels of welfare which fall well below the rigorous standards we set for all our suppliers we have immediately suspended the farm home farm in lincolnshire from our supply chain while we urgently investigate with rspca assureda glenrath spokesperson said bird welfare was a priority adding were disappointed animal activists chose to break into our farm causing a significant biosecurity and disease risk it is a criminal offence to break into a secure propertyit looks as though the activists were in the shed whilst the birds were resting which would cause them to become upset and distressed when birds are resting nest boxes are routinely closedwhilst a misshapen beak is unfortunate and the industry makes great efforts to ensure accurate beak trimming occasionally some birds do still have misaligned beaks there was no indication birds were struggling to feed or drink they saidquestioning whether birds became lame or died because of intruders they said a vet who inspected the hens detected no welfare issuesbut the investigators said they did nothing illegal having got in through an unlocked door and a damaged pop hole – which they said they filmedthey also put on coveralls and booties so posed no biosecurity risk which was also videoed ajp saidan rspca assured spokesperson said this footage is very distressing to watch and we launched an investigation as soon as we were made aware of itas part of that investigation rspca assured assessors have made unannounced inspections of the three farms that are members of the rspca assured scheme weve also analysed the footage to identify any breaches of the rspca welfare standardswe can confirm that we have suspended one of the farms pending further investigation this means they cannot market or sell any products under the rspca assured label our investigation into the other two farms is ongoing and we are unable to comment further at this timea fourth farm shown in the footage cancelled its membership in february so we are unable to investigatesadly from time to time things can go wrong on farms but one case of poor welfare is still one too many which is why we have taken these allegations very seriouslyasda aligned itself with the response of the british retail consortium brc which represents all supermarkets andrew opie of the brc said members worked closely with trusted suppliers to ensure high welfare standards were upheld they have strict processes in place and will thoroughly investigate evidence of welfare breaches he saidthe independent asked tesco to comment but did not receive a replya spokesperson for

which includes spot checks from third parties to ensure they meet our stringent welfare standardsas soon as we were shown this footage featuring one of our farms we launched an immediate review our team assessed the farm and the rspca carried out an independent and unannounced assessment on monday 29 april where the farm was found to be fully compliant with industry regulations and best practices the rspca had previously visited the farm only two weeks prior and has found no cause for concern at either visitthe british free range egg producer association was asked to comment on

inventors hope to crack how to create a reliable clean water supply on the moon – and it may involve a microwave oven from tescothe goal to set up a crewed lunar base was launched many moons ago but has yet to come to fruition with reliance on water supplies from earth risky and expensive one of the many challenges is how to extract and purify water from ice lying in craters at the lunar south polesuch a supply would not only provide a resource for drinking and growing crops but the water could also be split into hydrogen for use as rocket fuel and oxygen for residents to breathenow the uk space agency has announced that it is awarding £30000 in seed funding with expert support to each of 10 uk teams who are vying to solve the problemlolan naicker of naicker scientific ltd one of the uk finalists of the aqualunar challenge said throwing open the conundrum to the public allows people with very different approaches to problemsolving and very different backgrounds to put forward potential answersits extremely difficult to actually come up with a viable solution he saidnaicker added that the first part of his teams plan is to microwave the dirty lunar ice im literally going to go out today buy a microwave oven from tesco across the road and strip it down take out the magnetron and then try to incorporate that into the first part of my process he saidnaicker and his team members are working on a sonochem system that will use powerful sound waves to generate millions of tiny bubbles in lunar water within which high temperatures and pressures are produced that naicker said produces highly reactive substances known as free radicals that break down contaminants in the waterbut while the team have a core idea there is much more to doremember we need to get from this dirty ice to liquid water first and we need to do this in an environment thats 200c – its vacuum conditions he saidthe teams only have seven months to develop their ideas before a winner and two runnersup are chosen in spring 2025 with the selected trio to share a further £300000 to continue work on their solutions in addition approximately £600000 is being dedicated to rewarding solutions from canadianled teamsmeganne christian a uk space agency reserve astronaut and chair of the aqualunar challenge judging panel said it is early days for nasas artemis mission supported by the european space agency and others which aims to put humans back on the moonso its the right moment to have innovators looking into how to purify water on the moon – and to be fair we didnt actually know that there was water on the moon until relatively recently she saidchristian added that the aqualunar challenge – which is funded by the uk space agencys international bilateral fund and managed by challenge works in collaboration with the canadian space agency – has a hugely diverse range of finalists with teams also considering how the technologies could be applied on earthnaicker said his team has a number of plans we could build a slightly bigger system put it on the back of a van and drive it out to a wartorn area he said we could develop smaller appliances for the developing world where access to clean water is really challengingchristian added the idea is that the new technologies could be also used on other space missions where there is water icewe know that theres water ice on mars for example so absolutely these technologies could be adapted for use on mars and other planetary bodies wherever we decide to go in the future she saidthe nine other uk finalists in the aqualunar challenge includenascent semiconductor ltd  which is developing a compact system called the titaniadiamond annular reactor tidar this will break down contaminants in lunar soil using a titanium dioxide catalyst activated by ledbased uv light with diamond electrodesthe british interplanetary society in london  which has come up with ganymedes chalice – a device in which a curved mirror focuses the suns rays on an airlocked crucible containing lunar ice the components within the ice can then be boiled in turn and storedqueen mary university of london  whose team is creating aqualunarpure a reactor that heats lunar ice to leave behind solid material then heats it to more than 373c at 220 bars of pressure to turn it into supercritical water whereby contaminants are removed by oxidationminima design ltd suffolk  which has developed a cyclic volatile extractor cve – in which dirty ice is heated within a novel closed chamber under variable pressures allowing different contaminants to be removed and storedredspace ltd  which has come up with frank a filtered regolith aqua neutralisation kit in which lunar soil is heated to remove volatile gases before the remaining material is passed through a membrane to separate solid particles and liquid the latter is then distilled to obtain waterperspective spacetech ltd  which has created an innovative lunar water resource

inventors hope to crack how to create a reliable clean water supply on the moon – and it may involve a microwave oven from tescothe goal to set up a crewed lunar base was launched many moons ago but has yet to come to fruition with reliance on water supplies from earth risky and expensive one of the many challenges is how to extract and purify water from ice lying in craters at the lunar south polesuch a supply would not only provide a resource for drinking and growing crops but the water could also be split into hydrogen for use as rocket fuel and oxygen for residents to breathenow the uk space agency has announced that it is awarding £30000 in seed funding with expert support to each of 10 uk teams who are vying to solve the problemlolan naicker of naicker scientific ltd one of the uk finalists of the aqualunar challenge said throwing open the conundrum to the public allows people with very different approaches to problemsolving and very different backgrounds to put forward potential answersits extremely difficult to actually come up with a viable solution he saidnaicker added that the first part of his teams plan is to microwave the dirty lunar ice im literally going to go out today buy a microwave oven from tesco across the road and strip it down take out the magnetron and then try to incorporate that into the first part of my process he saidnaicker and his team members are working on a sonochem system that will use powerful sound waves to generate millions of tiny bubbles in lunar water within which high temperatures and pressures are produced that naicker said produces highly reactive substances known as free radicals that break down contaminants in the waterbut while the team have a core idea there is much more to doremember we need to get from this dirty ice to liquid water first and we need to do this in an environment thats 200c – its vacuum conditions he saidthe teams only have seven months to develop their ideas before a winner and two runnersup are chosen in spring 2025 with the selected trio to share a further £300000 to continue work on their solutions in addition approximately £600000 is being dedicated to rewarding solutions from canadianled teamsmeganne christian a uk space agency reserve astronaut and chair of the aqualunar challenge judging panel said it is early days for nasas artemis mission supported by the european space agency and others which aims to put humans back on the moonso its the right moment to have innovators looking into how to purify water on the moon – and to be fair we didnt actually know that there was water on the moon until relatively recently she saidchristian added that the aqualunar challenge – which is funded by the uk space agencys international bilateral fund and managed by challenge works in collaboration with the canadian space agency – has a hugely diverse range of finalists with teams also considering how the technologies could be applied on earthnaicker said his team has a number of plans we could build a slightly bigger system put it on the back of a van and drive it out to a wartorn area he said we could develop smaller appliances for the developing world where access to clean water is really challengingchristian added the idea is that the new technologies could be also used on other space missions where there is water icewe know that theres water ice on mars for example so absolutely these technologies could be adapted for use on mars and other planetary bodies wherever we decide to go in the future she saidthe nine other uk finalists in the aqualunar challenge includenascent semiconductor ltd  which is developing a compact system called the titaniadiamond annular reactor tidar this will break down contaminants in lunar soil using a titanium dioxide catalyst activated by ledbased uv light with diamond electrodesthe british interplanetary society in london  which has come up with ganymedes chalice – a device in which a curved mirror focuses the suns rays on an airlocked crucible containing lunar ice the components within the ice can then be boiled in turn and storedqueen mary university of london  whose team is creating aqualunarpure a reactor that heats lunar ice to leave behind solid material then heats it to more than 373c at 220 bars of pressure to turn it into supercritical water whereby contaminants are removed by oxidationminima design ltd suffolk  which has developed a cyclic volatile extractor cve – in which dirty ice is heated within a novel closed chamber under variable pressures allowing different contaminants to be removed and storedredspace ltd  which has come up with frank a filtered regolith aqua neutralisation kit in which lunar soil is heated to remove volatile gases before the remaining material is passed through a membrane to separate solid particles and liquid the latter is then distilled to obtain waterperspective spacetech ltd  which has created an innovative lunar water resource system called ilunasys in which lunar samples are heated to remove impurities as gas reverse osmosis is then used to separate water molecules from the sample with the final step involving a uv filtration systemshaun fletcher and dr lukman yusuf from the university of glasgow  who plan to melt dirty ice remove large soil particles and then pump the water through an ultrasound system this will remove gases destroy pollutants and clump together any lunar dust before the water is filtered to remove remaining contaminantsregolithix ltd  who are developing a regolith ice plasma purifier for lunar exploration ripple in which dirty lunar ice will be heated with water vapour and solid particles separated by a device akin to a salad spinner the vapour can then be split using a plasma torch and the hydrogen and oxygen isolated using a molecular sieveinterstellar mapping  which have come up with a static water extraction system swes to sublimate different volatile substances in the lunar soil at lower temperatures than ice and water are extracted and stored the sample is then heated again to turn the water to steam which is extracted and cooledcopyright c 2024

while tesco mobile ranked first for overall customer satisfaction the survey found tesco mobile subscribers are most satisfied with the cost of their subscription and geographical coverage provided this contrasts with overall responses as these two factors were the most reported causes of customer dissatisfaction from all subscribers

economic pressures diminishing value for money
consumer inflation in the uk has increased pressure on subscribers to minimise outgoings including their mobile contracts mobile subscribers are much more open to lowcost subscription offers and deals on handsets


to capitalise on these findings the report recommends operators expand their contract offers to cater to lowerspending subscribers

gtgt good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today at hatton garden weve made this as efficient as possible so im going to get straight into the numbers so we first set out our strategy to pivot profitability in july 22 and im pleased to present the results for the year ending march 24 which demonstrate the output of this strategy importantly during the year weve also been taking action to return us to growth and in the final quarter aocom returned to revenue growth we delivered our record ever group adjusted pbt of 34 million up 22 million on the previous year which is now at 33 of revenue eps was 429p per share up over 380 year on year and were progressing towards our medium term pbt target of 5 going forward i expect revenue growth will leverage overheads to improve this metric further gross margins also improved and is now just over 23 this growth comes as a result of the increased mda product mix as well as an increase in the average product value which has improved the amortization of delivery costs this is further supported by our performance of our product protection plan customer base and is on top of the benefit from delivery charges and range rationalization as well as further efficiency savings in our logistics operation there are some headwinds going into fy25 as latent inflationary pressures materialize and were working hard to mitigate the impact our cash has converted well to profits capex was in line with our plan albeit the decision to buy affordable mobiles and buy mobiles was an unforeseen opportunity the actions weve taken to improve profitability resulted in a net revenue decrease year on year of about 9 albeit aocom grew in the final quarter of the year our mda market share remains strong at over 15 and the markets down about 1 year on year which we anticipate is the bottom of the cycle the increase in service revenue is driven mainly by the introduction of delivery charges and membership income commission revenue is made up of product protection plans and mobile phone contract sales our product protection plan customers continue to recognize the value and peace of mind it represents and the volume of plans fell in line with retail sales but the retention of customers improved which has positively impacted profitability this year our mobile business has had a very difficult year the new contract market was down about 14 year on year which has been challenging as depressed customer demand place volume pressure on our volume commitments to networks with that suppressed market competition for customers intensified leading to increased expenditure in the acquisition of customers through affiliate channels and unsustainable discounts to try and achieve volume targets mobile remains a key part of our strategy however we could not feasibly continue to trade under the conditions seen in 2023 therefore at the start of the calendar year we reset our approach firstly we reengineered the business in partnership with the networks to remove the dysfunctionality so that our goals are aligned and secondly we strengthened our market position with the additional of affordable mobiles and buy mobiles and we expect this to reduce the pressure on acquisition costs and to be a source of natural traffic and then finally we continue to leverage our logistics and recycling network for third party customers where it doesnt distract from our core business the actions weve discussed before on range and profit rationalization helped us to deliver record gross margin a 234 with margins in h2 being similar to h1 weve discussed that the mobile business has been impacted by shrinking market and the resultant competitive pressure which has had a negative drag on overall margin this was offset to some degree by the improvement in retention in our product protection plan base during the year and were committed to growing our retail business and the improved customer offerings through finance membership new categories and so on will be a key part of that growth and johns going to explain the strategy for that shortly this changing mix will result in a slightly dilutive impact to gross margin in the coming financial year so turning to our sgampa costs weve delivered savings of 19 million yearonyear and on a twoyear basis of 65 million firmly demonstrating the output of our pivot to profit for the longterm benefit of the business we have continued to invest in marketing although we have changed the focus of our spend away from direct acquisition towards brand investment as we look to cement our most trusted positioning with customers as previously mentioned the dynamics in mobile resulted in an increased cost of acquisition which we dont expect to continue on a goforward basis in warehousing costs weve delivered a number of efficiencies which have contributed to us delivering not only a cash yearonyear saving which you would expect with the decline in sales but also an improvement in efficiency as we have reduced the cost as a percentage of sales too our overhead control has continued with a yearonyear saving of about nine million the nature of some contracts means there has been a lag in the increase of some costs where inflationary pressures have continued to materialize despite the fall in the headline rate of inflation weve experienced this as we exit fy24 and enter fy25 and government policy on minimum wage is driving high wage inflation in some of our lowerpaid operational roles weve also invested two million in the year in the first stage of our erp implementation the investment will continue and increase slightly in the coming two or three years as we ensure our systems and processes are resilient and scalable for future growth so weve talked through our revenue and our cost lines and im pleased with the pbt output which shows yearonyear growth of 22 million delivering pbt of 33 which is up 22 versus the previous year we remain focused on efficiency savings as we now turn our focus to growth so profits converted to cash during the period the swings we witnessed in working capital over the last couple of years have now normalized and weve chosen to make some investments in inventory as we look to maximize availability for customers this is particularly in slowmoving products as well as those where manufacturer lead times can be long or inconsistent and as a result stock days have increased to 43 weve seen a cash inflow of about 28 million as a result of the reduction in trade receivables and the receivables of the mobile business as well as tiding up the legacy of b2b trade and other payables have also fallen yearonyear now this is largely a timing impact in the mobile business as purchasing cycles align themselves to sales investment in capex was eight million during the year with the key assets being the site for our recycling operation in telford and the acquisition of the mobile ip now we do expect to see capex increase into fy25 to about 11 million and the increase largely being the purchase of vehicles which are in their normal renewal cycle but we will now likely buy those rather than wed previously leased them weve extended our â£80 million revolving credit facility by another year to april 27 and kthis is on the same terms with our existing partners and its undrawn at the end of the year as we exited fy 24 we saw aocom return to growth and expect this trajectory to continue in the coming year and john is going to cover the strategy for this shortly well continue to leverage the fixed costs in our business although we do expect to see some short term inflation which will proactively manage our expectations for the coming year is to deliver double digit growth and adjusted pbt between about 30641 million and our medium term aspirations remain unchanged to improve pbt margins towards 5 to grow our revenue in double digits and to grow our eps faster than revenue and on that positive note ill pass you to john gtgt so as youve just seen in marks section weve made real progress in improving our profitability and this is going to be a continuous journey but the heavy lifting of that is firmly done and with the benefit of hindsight while many businesses were paralyzed by issues like working from home and cost inflation and i think a lot of still waiting for that storm to pass were really glad that we had the courage of our convictions to take early decisive action and i think thats the advantage of living through 24 years of storms that you really do learn how to dance in the rain that said the depth of the effort in getting to here should not at all be underestimated and im really grateful to the entire ao team our supplier partners our shareholders for everyones support over the last 18 months as weve gone through the journey as a result weve ended the year a much simpler business in a steady state performing better than ever for customers with outstanding unit economics and crucially our culture which underpins everything is firmly back and even stronger than ever post covid thats not to say that we wont get more profitable from here with growth but the business foundations are now good which is evidenced by todays numbers looking forward our ambition is to be a double digit growth business every year for the next five years now i know its easy to be skeptical about this especially in the current economic climate so i just want to spend a little bit of time setting out the broad plan that underpins our confidence to achieve this ambition our approach is based entirely on self help taking share by offering customers a great proposition in a broadly flat market which will create operational gearing and any replacement cycle that may come from the covid peak that will be incremental for context on the opportunity our current share of the mda market is around 15 give or take and yet our share in all other categories is around 2 or less of the market to manage your expectations though upfront we wont be releasing all the micro details about our plans our overarching strategy is to create an even more loyal customer base and win a better share of wallet from total household spend in the electricals category and we have a number of mechanisms to achieve this with a range of customer cohorts during the covid period we transacted with around three million new customers and they all had a fantastic first time experience with ao and with our brand at a time when they really needed us we believe and were seeing that they continue to repeat and buy new categories from us and its really important that were already seeing this weve taken the first steps in improving our proposition and fixing the unit economics of those other categories as well outside our mda heritage were competing with a broader set of retailers both online and in store where the reality is today is that we dont have an obvious right to win in those categories what are we doing about that we lets start by looking at those customer cohorts that we can build and how we can drive loyalty to ao so finance customers well they give us a greater share of their wallet across categories and they shop more frequently thats because once theyve gone through the process of opening a credit account its more convenient for them to shop with us and of course they already have the reassurance of knowing that they have access to that credit weve been building our finance base which currently stands at just over half a million active customers and they have about three quarters of a billion pounds available to spend on their accounts we now also have a growing ao membership and that base pay 39 pounds a year for the benefit of free delivery free recycling and great member deals those members are already demonstrating a willingness to give us a greater share of their wallet giving us a clear right to win with them across new categories similarly in our insurance business we now have over a million customers paying us a monthly direct debit and trusting us for their peace of mind members with both finance accounts and insurance give us an even greater share of their wallet in our mobile business we now have over 11 million active customers and members who have finance accounts insurance products and a mobile phone well guess what they give us an even greater share of their wallet so im sure you can see where im going with it the further that we deepen our relationship with customers at scale the greater our right to win a bigger share of their wallet and so the more our unit economics improve in turn this enables us to keep investing in the reasons for customers to share that wallet with us all the data that sits behind this is clearly extremely commercially sensitive so today im really just outlining the principles of the flywheel that drives what we think of as our shared economics model and this enables us to share those unit economics with customers and to share value creation with investors it also allows us to deepen our relationships with suppliers through a greater ability to directionally sell products to our members plus from a people perspective playing for a winning team is just a lot more fun than battling relegation which is hugely rewarding for all aos who thrive in that high performance fast paced culture and ultimately its the data that we can see building behind all that and the compounding effect of the customer cohorts that underpins our confidence in the ambition of double digit growth and as mark alluded to we also believe theres possibly a medium term tailwind on the horizon as well because of the amount of volume that was pulled forward into the covid lockdown period for context mda volumes were 162 million units in 2020 154 million units in 21 compared to only 129 million units in 2023 now our planning assumes that we stick with todays historically low volumes and that they will continue in the short term but we are now four years from the start of the covid spike and even with slightly longer purchase cycles of electricals it does seem reasonable to assume that there will be some growth returning to the replacement cycles from those covid peaks four years ago in the not too distant future as ever none of this is going to be absolute plain sailing or a perfectly smooth journey and our desire to keep driving at ao speed and keep innovating will create oscillations on the trajectory of our growth but equally the long term trend will be upwards just as it has been for the last 24 years and building these cohorts will take time it requires lots of lessons and learnings and itll also occasionally need investment at times im sure there will also need to be occasional leaps of faith and an unwavering commitment to the cause but i am more convinced than ever that this is the best strategy to create value for everyone from shareholders and customers to our people and amidst all the talk of strategy i dont want anyone to take for granted the brilliant retail basics that are so crucial to our business and will continue to underpin our success and thats why we continue and always will obsess about them every day be that range price delivery speed of delivery availability delivery execution delivery with a smile installation and always been there for customers with a human touch that obsession recently manifested itself in us passing the half a million trust pilot reviews milestone with a trust score of 48 out of five meaning that ao is now the biggest scale trust pilot retailer in the uk with the highest quality rating thats a really proud moment and frankly its the scorecard of just thousands and thousands of hours of great customer service lessons and all this forms the foundation for that very simple message that we are as you all well know the uks most trusted electrical retailer we have a firm conviction that the need for those brilliant retail basics is not going to change any time soon and that means that we can really continue to invest in them with confidence plus as ive said many times before the reality is that the best service is actually no service it should all just work and its also the most profitable service because every intervention costs money and youve seen that in the results today and all of this in turn gives us a clear structural advantage over time through the trust that it will generate with customers and other stakeholders and so with that ill finish where i started by reiterating our confidence which i hope some of you will now be more inclined to share a little of the ao will be back to double digit growth every year for the next five years and with our medium term pbt target in excess of 5 and having all that manifest into what i think of as just good old fashioned cash so thank you for everyones time today thank you for coming along and before we move to qampa as a point of housekeeping weve got a microphone so if you can take the microphone and before asking a question if you can just state your name and organization so that anyone watching can hear thank you gtgt hi there ben hunt from invested you talk about the need to improve unit economics and it feels like more of a growth to achieve these medium term objections its got to come from the nonmda categories historically theres obviously been your warehousing configuration is set up for mda can you perhaps talk about any plans or progress youre making improving perhaps those unit economics gtgt quite simply weve fixed all the unit economics youre dead right all our operations in our heritage of mda are built to move big stuff around with two man home delivery and you need a completely different operation with much more automation for smaller boxes and so what weve done through the year is weve in simple terms moved all of that small stuff out of our two man operation and weve partnered with a business called dcc leverage in their capital investment theres no capital investment for us and we put our volume through that and its been a careful journey to make sure that we do that and we tie all that together from a tech and a customer proposition point of view as well as fixing the unit economics and again theres more stages of that to come through the year but the growth that we will see in those newer categories through repeat business will drive us towards our 5 pbt target so the economic element of that is done gtgt and in a second can you just talk a little bit more about the mobile market the second half looked quite poor you allude to the connections being down and maybe context to the two new mobile sites that youve acquired and how that relationship is going to improve with the mobile network operators and your volume commitments gtgt so in simple terms we were clear when we set out our update at the end of last year the key part of our pivot to profit strategy was that if we could not see business units with a line of sight to profitability and cash generation wed come out of it and weve got lots of examples germany being the biggest one but our partnership with tesco was another one house builders was another one and a mobile was another one on the list i was really clear the new contract market on mobile has got an enormous amount of dysfunctionality and bad behavior thats built into it thats not a business that we wanted this will be the last year of pain for our mobile business were building different agreements now in partnership with the networks where we win together or we lose together and obviously as mark mentioned we opportunistically wasnt in our plan to buy one a1 as was one of our biggest competitors in that market through the period as well so it wont be a case of putting those two businesses together and it being the combined entity itll be smaller than the combined entity but itll be a much better business for us and it should generate cash and it should contribute profit gtgt good morning caroline gulliver from equity development my first question was around operating leverage you mentioned that obviously theres minimum wage increases putting a bit of solid cost inflation still in this year but as we look forward and youre generating double digit revenue growth what are some of the levers or what might you like to invest in and how much should we expect might fall to profitability in getting towards that 5 pbt margin gtgt well at its most simple level were guiding our journey towards 5 pbt well have lots of choices then of how we think about that if you look at a very macro level i dont know the exact numbers but its about 11 of our sales go to pay central overhead that central overhead is extremely well invested and doesnt rise in line with sales mark and i are quite expensive we dont need another me we dont need another mark so we will be leveraging a lot of that central overhead as we go through but naturally well have improved unit economics through leverage of central warehousing and things like that so its across the piece we will continue to obsess about efficiencies ive always said even through the pivot to profit you never cut your way to success so this was about repositioning the business weve done that we are back to growth we are confident we can see all the things that are going to drive growth but its not as though were going to go and spend lets go and spend 10 million on tv to drive the growth this is about much more ive used the phrase many times of reassuringly boring when weve got these building these cohorts in a high value ticket environment with low frequency of purchase is expensive and takes time and the point that were highlighting is we put 600000 new customers into our business this year at the level of service that were providing theres seeds for next years sales theres seeds for this years sales and as we improve things like the awareness of the other categories that were selling and as we get more members as we get more finance accounts that engine and that flywheel just drives theres no silver bullet in this this is now moving through the phases of growth and it is broadly playing out exactly as we thought it would and that drives our economic model but the important thing is for me that we dont expect all that to flow to the bottom line because were operating a shared economics model so customers are paying 39 pounds for free delivery free recycling and member pricing the more profitable we can make the business the more we can invest in that flywheel to give them better value for their 39 pounds as well and we can do that across lots of different metrics with lots of different levers and thats why i dont want to really go into the micro detail of that because there are so many choices for us to make the key is for people to focus on us being back to being a double digit growth business on a journey to 5 pbt gtgt thank you gtgt and then we made it to roughly 7080 inaudible 002530 gtgt were going to make our business balance sheet bulletproof thats priority 1 and 2022 was a difficult year for us were never going to go there again so absolute bulletproof and then well think about it thereafter in my category as high class problems and well deal with it when we get to it gtgt good morning guys what do you talk a bit about where we are on the journey in terms of increasing that range and small domestic prices and inaudible 002610 category and i suppose as well just how youre thinking about maintaining that customer experience that trust you move out with someone else take responsibility filment i guess that delivery is been a big part of differentiate gtgt yeah so theres no massive change in that so we primarily partner with dpd around delivery but we have done even when those products were coming out of our two man warehouse most of it still went on a dpd vehicle their service is very good weve got everything in the background to deal with that if its not we fall back on weve got amazing people in our customer service team and our obsession with customer service make sure that those customers get looked after and so that dpd service has been in place for years and so there wont be any outward change on that in terms of where are we on the journey id probably score as 34 out of 10 but as material progress because we were probably more like oneandahalf to two and so we will bring more of that range into our own stock holding well take more of the risk of stock well build more credibility in those categories were already seeing that well deepen our relationships with the brands and the manufacturers of the products and as the awareness within our existing customer base grows then logically were already seeing our market shares in those newer categories materially over index with existing and repeat customers than it does with new customers so its just a journey and again it isnt a light switch its just a progression but to be clear were only 15 share in mda its not the end of our mda growth journey so those 600000 new customers this year i expect them to buy mda from us as well gtgt and is that better reason to expect we should see stock in terms of stock holding trend up a bit as you move into those small domestic categories for the more scale gtgt i think that should make sense nothing of any great materiality to be concerned about in the same way that weve had supply chain disruption everybody is pretty well reported around the disruption thats happened stuff that comes from the far east is now taking longer so our priority is to maintain the proposition and protect customers from any impact of that so we have increased our stock holding in certain areas because of that as well so its a great investment stock is a wonderful investment for us we have relatively microscopic obsolescence within that stock so it genuinely is a great investment for us gtgt and from a work of capital point of view youll see an offset in trade creditors so if there is an increase in stock the offset credit theres no investment gtgt are there any wave from jeffreys following on the nonmda theme you should talked about that category helping drive towards 5 pbt margin you talked about it being fixed from economic perspective does that mean that this year as in now the economics are where theyre going to get to or is there still a journey on gross margin which youre going to be going through over time as you scale as the first one gtgt i mean so yes we fixed the delivery element and the warehousing element of it i think there is still a progression to go with the manufacturers of those products that will develop over time so i think theres more opportunity to go but the day 1 do we not lose money on this stuff anymore thats the more to make yes there is gtgt and i think just build on that the very manual way of warehousing and moving those products around has been removed and weve got all the benefits of all the automation in effect without the capx operation gtgt okay thanks thats clear second one on that from a customerfacing perspective on the nonmda what is going to look different is the range going to be bigger is it going to be a bit more obvious and a bit more as input in but promotion as in visibility perhaps on the website and is probably going to be a bit sharper i dont know gtgt everything so i mean it literally is everything so from a proposition perspective the ultimate goal is nextday delivery every day seven days a week for up til midnight so how you get to that so pushing back that time window so customers can shop longer for nextday delivery increasing the range improving the web journey as well our website it has some fundamental flaws in it because it was built for mda so if you want to download software in our system it has to have a color so you download white software and so in the background were paying some of this mark talked about on the system debt of paying some of that down so that we can present those products specific by category were here at hatton garden which is at the heart of our creative hub of how we create content for customers to be able to shop products better and so were getting ever better at how we tell those product stories with different complications shopping consumer electronics is just a mind field for the average consumer and so what we are historically very good at is taking that customer journey and making that customer journey much better so it really is across everything and then of course price we want a price reason for customers to shop with us and those customers that are investing with us in being members theyre enabling us to invest back in their shared economics model gtgt okay thanks and then last one on the other admin element of your cost base is about 11 i think now you talk about it being substantially fixed from here on in where can that get down to in time gtgt or is that entirely dependent on where top line gets to gtgt yeah then thats the answer is that the cash amount is prefixed or its going to go up with inflation but it is a prefixed and wellinvested number and so the question is wheres the top line going in inaudible 003310 gtgt fine all right thanks gtgt importantly though andy what we choose to do with that in the shared economics model if we drive another four or 5 of saving out of that central overhead over time that doesnt necessarily mean were going to choose to as jeff bezos used to say your margin is my opportunity we really want to drive that volumeshared economics model and choose where to reinvest those operational savings that we create gtgt sounding more like a costco model gtgt say again gtgt sounding more like a costco model gtgt funny that okay any other questions all right great well its great to be back to growth and to be delivering fantastic results today record ever profit and thanks for being here to listen to it thank you gtgt thanks",2024-06-27,Tesco,social
