- How The Development of Awaruite Deposits in Canada May Help
- Alleviate Projected Shortages of Nickel Concentrate

     FinancialNewsMedia.com News Commentary - The refining of sulfide
nickel deposits usually requires a smelting capacity not present in North
America. It is controlled by China. Smelting is an environmentally harmful
process worse than C02 that can cause environmental damage (water, air).
Tailings from sulphide minerals in mining waste have the potential to
create acid. China Controls 68-80% of nickel refining smelting, and
controls 84% of the Indonesia Nickel Market. A report from the Brookings
Institute said that: Even if the U.S. and EU were to dig more minerals out
of the ground, many of these minerals would need to be shipped overseas for
concentrating, refining, and smelting without significant increases in U.S.
and European mineral refining and smelting capacity. The U.S., in
particular, will likely have to update and amend its mining regulatory
regime. Governments will also have to onshore or friend-shore smelting and
refining capacity. The midstream part of the equation is likely to be the
most challenging, complicated by high investment costs and market
conditions. Active Companies mentioned in the article include: First
Atlantic Nickel Corp. (OTCQB: FANCF) (TSX-V: FAN), Alaska Energy Metals
Corporation (TSX-V: AEMC) (OTCQB: AKEMF), Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F),
General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM), TMC the metals company Inc. (NASDAQ: TMC).

     The U.S. Government (USGS) sees a better way saying: The development
of awaruite deposits in other parts of Canada may help alleviate any
prolonged shortage of nickel concentrate. Awaruite, a natural iron-nickel
alloy, is much easier to concentrate than pentlandite, the principal
sulfide of nickel. Awaruite is safer and more economical to process due to
the magnetic separation and concentration. It uses less chemicals, less
energy, can be processed directly in North America and since no smelting is
required doesnt need to go to China. Awaruite means no burning, which
releases sulfur dioxide and other toxic emissions, and less risk of acid
mine tailings accidents or contaminations (no sulphide minerals present).

     A report from Science Direct said: Nickel is an important component of
stainless steel and a wide range of applications which are critical for the
transition to clean energies including electric vehicle batteries. Awaruite
is a native nickeliron alloy that has gained interest as a possible new
economic source of nickel. In the last decades, there have been discoveries
of awaruite, mostly with more significant amounts of nickel sulphides, that
have demonstrated the potential for awaruite to contribute to the economics
of a deposit. This study is focused on the very large Baptiste deposit in
central British Columbia, Canada where awaruite is the primary nickel
mineral. It concluded: Awaruite has the potential to be concentrated in a
unique and valuable nickel concentrate of distinctive characteristics
including its very high nickel content, which lowers both the downstream
costs and the carbon intensity. Furthermore, the negligible content of
sulphur and penalty trace elements, such as mercury, antimony, and arsenic
in a potential awaruite concentrate, minimizes the costs of refining it.

     First Atlantic Nickel Corp. (OTCQB: FANCF) (TSX-V: FAN) Hosts
Strategic Investor Site Visit, Expands Geological Team, and Reports
Milestones on Infrastructure Upgrades at Atlantic Nickel Project - First
Atlantic Nickel Corp. (FSE: P21) (""First Atlantic"" or the ""Company"") is
pleased to provide an update on the progress at its wholly-owned Atlantic
Nickel Project in central Newfoundland, Canada (the ""Project"" or the
""Atlantic Nickel Project""). The Company recently completed the first site
visit with a strategic corporate investor (the ""Strategic Investor""), which
included examining nickel-bearing occurrences and historical drill core.
First Atlantic welcomes the Strategic Investor's support, knowledge, and
experience in mining project exploration and development.

     Highlights:

//st

  * First site visit at Atlantic Nickel Project with Corporate Strategic
Investor completed.
  * Awaruite identified as visible grains in previous drill core from
Atlantic Lake Area.
  * First bridge installed as part of road upgrade and development program,
enabling year-round Project access.
  * Technical Advisor, Dr. Ron Britten has conducted a site visit to
examine awaruite nickel occurrences and will help lead the charge to
discover a potential large scale deposit.
  * Permits filed for phase 2 of new all-weather road construction.
  * Geological team with awaruite experience expanded to accelerate
district-scale exploration efforts along extensive 30 km trend.

//et

     Project Road Update: First Atlantic is also pleased to announce the
installation of the first bridge as part of its infrastructure upgrade
program on the Project. The Company anticipates the completion of two
additional bridges, allowing for the establishment of operations directly
on the Project site, enhancing future operational efficiency.

     The installation of the first bridge marks a significant milestone in
conducting large-scale district-size mining exploration operations. The
road will provide faster and closer access to additional awaruite zones
throughout the district, allowing for year-round exploration work and
drilling. Improved road access reduces the cost per meter of drilling,
enabling significantly more drilling activities.

     Exploration Updates: Preparations are underway for the Exploration
Camp with a permit in place. The camp will serve as a strategic base for
on-site operations, enabling the exploration team to work efficiently in
the field. To ensure year-round access to the site, road upgrades are being
implemented, allowing for easy ground access regardless of the season.

     The exploration program is focusing on grading and prioritizing
awaruite outcrops, as well as sampling and mapping prospective drill
targets along the 30km trend. A LiDAR/Photos airborne program is also being
planned to aid in this work, providing high-resolution topographic data and
aerial imagery. The LiDAR data will help identify key geological
structures, while the aerial photos will be used to visually identify
outcrops for the geological team to investigate on the ground. This
integrated approach will further support exploration and development
efforts.

     Technical Advisor, Dr. Ron Britten, has completed an initial site
visit and is working closely with the First Atlantic exploration team
on-site. With his decades of experience, including discovering the Baptiste
awaruite deposit containing over 10 billion pounds of nickel, Dr. Britten
will enhance the program. Dr. Britten's efforts will help outline the best
occurrences for targeting in the initial drill program planned for this
year. This large-scale district sampling program can continue during the
road construction phase necessary for full drilling operations. CONTINUED

OECIF support plays a key role in the development of new power and energy technologies, which provide the DoD with advanced capabilities and help prevent power and energy from being a limiting factor.TMC the metals company Inc. (NASDAQ: TMC), an explorer of the world’s largest estimated undeveloped source of critical battery metals, recently announced that it has successfully produced the world’s first cobalt sulfate derived exclusively from seafloor polymetallic nodules. The cobalt sulfate was generated during bench-scale testing of TMC’s hydrometallurgical flowsheet design with SGS Canada Inc. (“SGS”). The test work was carried out at SGS’ Metallurgical Centre of Excellence testing facility in Lakefield, Ontario.Based on samples of nickel-cobalt-copper matte first produced by TMC in 2021, the Extractive Metallurgy team at SGS tested TMC’s efficient flowsheet to process high-grade nickel-copper-cobalt matte directly to high-purity cobalt sulfate without making cobalt metal, while producing fertilizer byproducts instead of solid waste or tailings. This milestone follows last month’s successful production of nickel sulfate, a key raw material input used in the production of energy-dense electric vehicle batteries.About FN Media Group:At FN Media Group, via our top-rated online news portal at www.financialnewsmedia.com, we are one of the very few select firms providing top tier one syndicated news distribution, targeted ticker tag press releases and stock market news coverage for today’s emerging companies. #pressreleases #tickertagpressreleasesFollow us on Facebook to receive emerging news updates:https://www.facebook.com/financialnewsmediaFollow us on Twitter for real time Breaking News:https://twitter.com/FNMgroupFollow us on LinkedIn:https://www.linkedin.com/in/financialnewsmedia/DISCLAIMER: FN Media Group LLC (FNM), which owns and operates FinancialNewsMedia.com and MarketNewsUpdates.com, is a third party publisher and news dissemination service provider, which disseminates electronic information through multiple online media channels.

"NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 28, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces it has filed a lawsuit against UiPath, Inc.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the ""Class Period""). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was ""executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,"" asserted that ""our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,"" and that ""there's no doubt there's [been] better execution"" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused ""confusion"" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate ""execution strategy to scale"" the Company's AI-powered growth products ""to reach their full potential,"" and that AI had ""create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers."" Ui Path also described how the ""investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs"" while experiencing ""contract execution challenges on large deals.""This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

The complaint alleges that between February 13, 2023 and February 12, 2024, Teradata and certain of its senior executives made materially false and misleading statements related to: (a) the success of the company's recently expanded business model to market products to customers beyond their IT units; (b) the robustness of the company's pipeline and ability to timely close deals; and (c) the company's revenue growth prospects.The complaint further alleges that, in reality, Teradata's expanded business model caused significant delays in the closing of large customer transactions. As a result, it is alleged that the company overstated the health of its pipeline and revenue growth prospects.Investors allegedly began to learn the truth on December 7, 2023, when Teradata revealed that certain large deals could be delayed.

"NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 28, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces a lawsuit has been filed against MongoDB, Inc. (Nasdaq:MDB) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your MongoDB investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.Investors have until September 9, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and ""re-baselin[e]"" its entire Defense business.On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts.

For instance, the Company assured investors that ""[n]otwithstanding the additional volatility"" from ""acute short-term headwinds for the Defense sector, management maintains a highly positive view of its growth potential over a multi-year period.""On November 14, 2023, CAE stated that certain legacy contracts continued to be plagued by cost overruns.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the ""Class Period""). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was ""executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,"" asserted that ""our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,"" and that ""there's no doubt there's [been] better execution"" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused ""confusion"" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate ""execution strategy to scale"" the Company's AI-powered growth products ""to reach their full potential,"" and that AI had ""create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers."" Ui Path also described how the ""investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs"" while experiencing ""contract execution challenges on large deals.""This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the ""Class Period""). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was ""executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,"" asserted that ""our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,"" and that ""there's no doubt there's [been] better execution"" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused ""confusion"" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate ""execution strategy to scale"" the Company's AI-powered growth products ""to reach their full potential,"" and that AI had ""create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers."" Ui Path also described how the ""investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs"" while experiencing ""contract execution challenges on large deals.""This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

"NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 24, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces a lawsuit has been filed against MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your MongoDB investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.Investors have until September 9, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

"NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 22, 2024 / Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP (""BFA"") announces that it has filed a class action lawsuit for violations of the federal securities laws against CAE Inc. (""CAE"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE:CAE) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered a loss on your CAE investment, please submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases/cae-inc-investigation.The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in CAE who purchased or acquired CAE stock on an exchange in the United States between February 11, 2022 and May 21, 2024 inclusive (the ""Class Period""). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Norbert Gamache v. CAE Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05360. A copy of the lawsuit can be found here: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/CAEComplaint.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning significant cost overruns in CAE's Defense and Security (""Defense"") segment caused by several fixed-price, long-term Defense contracts entered prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and ""re-baselin[e]"" its entire Defense business.On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts. On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $4.32 per share, or more than 16%, from $25.80 per share on August 9, 2022, to $21.48 per share on August 10, 2022.Defendants, however, continued to make false representations regarding the strength of the Defense segment. For instance, the Company assured investors that ""[n]otwithstanding the additional volatility"" from ""acute short-term headwinds for the Defense sector, management maintains a highly positive view of its growth potential over a multi-year period.""On November 14, 2023, CAE stated that certain legacy contracts continued to be plagued by cost overruns. CAE revealed that, within the Defense segment, the Company planned to ""retir[e] legacy contracts, which have been most affected by inflationary pressures."" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $0.85 per share, or nearly 4%, from $21.92 per share on November 13, 2023, to $21.07 per share on November 14, 2023.Three months later, on February 14, 2024, CAE announced that it ""sought to further accelerate the retirement of outstanding program risks, mainly associated with certain legacy Defense contracts that we entered into pre-COVID and have been most impacted by economic headwinds."" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $2.01 per share, or nearly 10%, from $20.92 per share on February 13, 2024, to $18.91 per share on February 14, 2024.Finally, after the close of trading on May 21, 2024, CAE announced a ""re-baselining of its Defense business, Defense impairments, [and] accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts."" The Company stated that ""CAE has recorded a $568.0 million non-cash impairment of Defense goodwill,"" ""$90.3 million in unfavorable Defense contract profit adjustments as a result of accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts,"" and a ""$35.7 million impairment of related technology and other non-financial assets which are principally related to the Legacy Contracts."" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $1.03 per share, or more than 5%, from $19.83 per share on May 21, 2024, to $18.80 per share on May 22, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/cae-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in CAE, Inc. you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

"NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 22, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces an investigation into Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL) and its directors and certain senior executives for breaches of their fiduciary duties by failing to stop, and/or condoning, pervasive fraud and sexual harassment at the Company.If you are a long-term holder of Globe Life, you are encouraged to submit your information at: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.Investigation Details:A recent investor report has exposed troubling allegations that Globe Life is engaged in widespread insurance fraud. The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (""DOJ"").BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties. BFA intends to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of Globe Life stockholders and to ensure that the fiduciaries are held accountable for the Company's pervasive violations of the law.Click here if you are a long-term holder:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.What Can You Do?If you are a current holder of Globe Life Inc. stock, you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

"NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 22, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces a lawsuit has been filed against MongoDB, Inc. (Nasdaq:MDB) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your MongoDB investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.Investors have until September 9, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was ""executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,"" asserted that ""our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,"" and that ""there's no doubt there's [been] better execution"" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused ""confusion"" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate ""execution strategy to scale"" the Company's AI-powered growth products ""to reach their full potential,"" and that AI had ""create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers."" Ui Path also described how the ""investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs"" while experiencing ""contract execution challenges on large deals.""This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

"NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 21, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces it has filed a lawsuit against UiPath, Inc. (""UiPath"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE:PATH) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your UiPath investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.Investors have until August 19, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the ""Class Period""). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was ""executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,"" asserted that ""our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,"" and that ""there's no doubt there's [been] better execution"" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused ""confusion"" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate ""execution strategy to scale"" the Company's AI-powered growth products ""to reach their full potential,"" and that AI had ""create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers."" Ui Path also described how the ""investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs"" while experiencing ""contract execution challenges on large deals.""This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

"NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 21, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces an investigation into Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL) and its directors and certain senior executives for breaches of their fiduciary duties by failing to stop, and/or condoning, pervasive fraud and sexual harassment at the Company.If you are a long-term holder of Globe Life, you are encouraged to submit your information at: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.Investigation Details:A recent investor report has exposed troubling allegations that Globe Life is engaged in widespread insurance fraud. The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (""DOJ"").BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties. BFA intends to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of Globe Life stockholders and to ensure that the fiduciaries are held accountable for the Company's pervasive violations of the law.Click here if you are a long-term holder:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.What Can You Do?If you are a current holder of Globe Life Inc. stock, you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

The complaint alleges that between February 13, 2023 and February 12, 2024, Teradata and certain of its senior executives made materially false and misleading statements related to: (a) the success of the company's recently expanded business model to market products to customers beyond their IT units; (b) the robustness of the company's pipeline and ability to timely close deals; and (c) the company's revenue growth prospects.The complaint further alleges that, in reality, Teradata's expanded business model caused significant delays in the closing of large customer transactions. As a result, it is alleged that the company overstated the health of its pipeline and revenue growth prospects.Investors allegedly began to learn the truth on December 7, 2023, when Teradata revealed that certain large deals could be delayed.

"NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 19, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces a lawsuit has been filed against MongoDB, Inc. (Nasdaq:MDB) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your MongoDB investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.Investors have until September 9, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Norbert Gamache v. CAE Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05360. A copy of the lawsuit can be found here: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/CAEComplaint.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning significant cost overruns in CAE's Defense and Security (""Defense"") segment caused by several fixed-price, long-term Defense contracts entered prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and ""re-baselin[e]"" its entire Defense business.On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts.

"NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 18, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces an investigation into Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL) and its directors and certain senior executives for breaches of their fiduciary duties by failing to stop, and/or condoning, pervasive fraud and sexual harassment at the Company.If you are a long-term holder of Globe Life, you are encouraged to submit your information at: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.Investigation Details:A recent investor report has exposed troubling allegations that Globe Life is engaged in widespread insurance fraud. The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (""DOJ"").BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties. BFA intends to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of Globe Life stockholders and to ensure that the fiduciaries are held accountable for the Company's pervasive violations of the law.Click here if you are a long-term holder:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.What Can You Do?If you are a current holder of Globe Life Inc. stock, you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

"NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 18, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces a lawsuit has been filed against MongoDB, Inc. (Nasdaq:MDB) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your MongoDB investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.Investors have until September 9, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the ""Class Period""). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was ""executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,"" asserted that ""our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,"" and that ""there's no doubt there's [been] better execution"" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused ""confusion"" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate ""execution strategy to scale"" the Company's AI-powered growth products ""to reach their full potential,"" and that AI had ""create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.""

"NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 17, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces it has filed a lawsuit against UiPath, Inc.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the ""Class Period""). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was ""executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,"" asserted that ""our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,"" and that ""there's no doubt there's [been] better execution"" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused ""confusion"" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate ""execution strategy to scale"" the Company's AI-powered growth products ""to reach their full potential,"" and that AI had ""create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers."" Ui Path also described how the ""investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs"" while experiencing ""contract execution challenges on large deals.""This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

"NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 17, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces a lawsuit has been filed against MongoDB, Inc. (Nasdaq:MDB) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your MongoDB investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.Investors have until September 9, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Norbert Gamache v. CAE Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05360. A copy of the lawsuit can be found here: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/CAEComplaint.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning significant cost overruns in CAE's Defense and Security (""Defense"") segment caused by several fixed-price, long-term Defense contracts entered prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and ""re-baselin[e]"" its entire Defense business.On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts.

On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $2.01 per share, or nearly 10%, from $20.92 per share on February 13, 2024, to $18.91 per share on February 14, 2024.Finally, after the close of trading on May 21, 2024, CAE announced a ""re-baselining of its Defense business, Defense impairments, [and] accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts."" The Company stated that ""CAE has recorded a $568.0 million non-cash impairment of Defense goodwill,"" ""$90.3 million in unfavorable Defense contract profit adjustments as a result of accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts,"" and a ""$35.7 million impairment of related technology and other non-financial assets which are principally related to the Legacy Contracts.""

"NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 17, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces an investigation into Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL) and its directors and certain senior executives for breaches of their fiduciary duties by failing to stop, and/or condoning, pervasive fraud and sexual harassment at the Company.If you are a long-term holder of Globe Life, you are encouraged to submit your information at: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.Investigation Details:A recent investor report has exposed troubling allegations that Globe Life is engaged in widespread insurance fraud. The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (""DOJ"").BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties. BFA intends to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of Globe Life stockholders and to ensure that the fiduciaries are held accountable for the Company's pervasive violations of the law.Click here if you are a long-term holder:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.What Can You Do?If you are a current holder of Globe Life Inc. stock, you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

"NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 16, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces an investigation into Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL) and its directors and certain senior executives for breaches of their fiduciary duties by failing to stop, and/or condoning, pervasive fraud and sexual harassment at the Company.If you are a long-term holder of Globe Life, you are encouraged to submit your information at: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.Investigation Details:A recent investor report has exposed troubling allegations that Globe Life is engaged in widespread insurance fraud. The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (""DOJ"").BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties. BFA intends to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of Globe Life stockholders and to ensure that the fiduciaries are held accountable for the Company's pervasive violations of the law.Click here if you are a long-term holder:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.What Can You Do?If you are a current holder of Globe Life Inc. stock, you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found here.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was ""executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,"" asserted that ""our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,"" and that ""there's no doubt there's [been] better execution"" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading.

On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million.

"The automotive sector is one of the country's largest, contributing 4.3% to GDP and is also the country's fifth-largest export sector, accounting for 18.1% of total exports. It employs more than 110 000 peopleON Thursday, Ford Silverton workers took to the streets under the umbrella of the National Union of Metal Workers South Africa (Numsa), after talks with the company broke down last month.According to Numsa, the company was refusing to pay workers bonuses despite having the capacity to build 720 cars a day.Numsa is the country's largest trade union with more than 450,000 members, and it is the only union at Ford SA, according to treasurer Mphumzi Maqungo.The company has a staff complement of 3 500, 3 000 of whom are represented by Numsa.The automotive sector is one of the country's largest, contributing 4.3% to GDP and is also the country's fifth-largest export sector, accounting for 18.1% of total exports. It employs more than 110 000 people.After the notice was served, Ford responded by saying the strike would impact the local economy heavily, but, Numsa spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola insisted its members had been left with no choice but to down tools as Ford continued to benefit hugely from the sweat and labour of workers as management turned a blind eye to the challenges of workers.Numsa general secretary Irvin Jim said Ford was refusing to share its profits with workers, hence the strike.He added that Ford SA could afford to pay workers ""some kind of bonus"" as the company had ""made a fortune"" over the past four years.SA Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi said the labour federation supported the Numsa strike.""Given the profit growth the company has been able to score in the past several years, Saftu argues that Ford can afford the annual bonuses, not just incentive bonuses.""Furthermore, bonuses, like basic remuneration and profit, come from the surplus value that is created by workers in production. Primarily due to this, they are entitled to better remuneration, including bonuses, because they alone create the surplus value. Such surpluses should not only contribute to the wealth growth of shareholders but must benefit the workers who create it,"" said Vavi.He took issue that company executives were guaranteed annual bonuses while workers were offered ""incentive bonuses that are based on how well workers slave themselves to meet company targets"".Numsa members at Ford, in Mamelodi, on strike on Thursday as they demand their bonuses.

Description: A global rout in tech stocks sent European markets down across the board, while quarterly results from Stellantis, Renault and Kering also disappointed. On Friday's calendar are Mercedes-Benz, BASF and NatWest.

Video Transcript:
European shares tumble amid a global tech stock rout. Welcome to your Europe Markets Briefing. I am Elena Casas. The STOXX 600 is set for its worst day in over three months. The tech sector sank after a sell-off in US mega caps triggered by poor results from Tesla. Big European names also reported disappointing numbers. Stellantis and Renault both lost over 8% on the back of weak quarterly results, while luxury goods giant Kering fell 7.6% after a bigger-than-expected drop in second-quarter sales. Companies in the Eurozone's two biggest economies are growing more pessimistic, business surveys showed today. In Germany, the Ifo Business Climate Index fell for a fourth straight month. While in France, manufacturers said demand from abroad was weakening and morale in the services sector hit its worst level in more than three years. As President Macron welcomes business leaders to Paris ahead of tomorrow's Olympics, travel firms and airlines have been complaining that tourists are staying away. One strategist told us earlier that the latest economic projections for the Eurozone could turn out to be too optimistic.
Question marks about global growth will prove to be problematic for the Eurozone. So, we have seen those forward-looking survey indicators retreating quite significantly. Expectations within the Ifo survey dipped below the current reading, and that is a rather negative backdrop. So, I think that does suggest that the Euro macroeconomic projections are going to be challenged.
Well, after a fall in Lloyds' profits got UK bank earnings off to a weak start this morning, NatWest is up on Friday. The Conservative government was planning a major public share sale to reduce its 21% stake, but Labour has yet to announce its own plans. Stated pre-tax profits is expected to have dropped to GBP5.1 billion, down by nearly a sixth as interest income falls. Also, up tomorrow is Mercedes-Benz, after weak numbers from Stellantis, Ford, and Nissan today raised fears of a wider slowdown across the car industry. Also reporting are chemicals giant BASF and cement manufacturer Holcim. And flights were halted at Frankfurt Airport this morning after six climate change activists blocked runways by gluing themselves to the tarmac. The protestors were part of a Europe-wide wave of action that also disrupted airports in Switzerland and Norway this morning. While seven Just Stop Oil members were arrested at Heathrow. And that is your Europe Markets Briefing.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

California-based businesses can now get the Ford Pro™ Smart Charging Bundle, a new initiative to help make it easier for businesses to add electric vehicles to their fleet


The bundle offers a complimentary Ford Pro Level 2 EV charger to businesses subscribed to Ford Pro Charging software and gives them advanced energy management features to automate demand response to grid events, reporting, and manage Low Carbon Fuel Standard carbon credits for customers


Ford Pro™, Ford Motor Company’s commercial division, introduces the Ford Pro Smart Charging Bundle to California, one of America’s larger commercial fleet markets.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240717663208/en/(Photo: Business Wire)
Charging operations for electric vehicle fleets can be complex. The Ford Pro Smart Charging Bundle aims to help California businesses with electric vehicles in their fleet while improving operations and reducing upfront and ongoing EV charging costs. The bundle offers a complimentary Ford Pro Level 2 48-amp charger or a Level 2 80-amp charger for depot and workplace charging to businesses subscribed to Ford Pro Charging software.


Going electric for businesses isn’t just about lowering environmental impacts, it’s about the bottom line. The all-electric E-Transit™ requires no gasoline, scheduled maintenance is estimated to be 48 percent less than a gas-powered 2024 Transit®1, and businesses can use the smart charging software to schedule charging during off-peak hours when utility costs are typically lower.


The new automated demand-to-grid response solution in Ford Pro’s Charging Software reacts to grid events in California such as high local demand by automatically pausing charging, alerting the customer, and resuming charging when the event is over. This can help reduce the burden on the grid and reduce the risk of brownouts and blackouts for a more resilient power system. Ford Pro will manage the enrollment process for customers in California grid demand response programs that manage grid capacity, energy programs, and emergency load programs as well as the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) carbon credits program.


“California is an EV pioneer, and new regulations aim to accelerate businesses’ electric transition,” said Ted Cannis, Ford Pro CEO. “We’re here to do the heavy lifting and help companies navigate the complexities of electrification, helping them be more productive and efficient as they add EVs to their fleet. Our smart charging software helps businesses effectively manage their charging operations, including scheduled charging to avoid peak periods when electricity is in high demand at high rates and automated participation in grid events.”

Blue Bird is now the only school bus manufacturer in the United States to offer propane- and gasoline-powered school buses that will meet more stringent emission standards taking effect in 2027.Ford continues to supply its 7.3L V8 engine exclusively to school bus builder Blue Bird. ROUSH CleanTech integrates Ford's compact, durable and easy-to-maintain engine into low-emission powertrain options for propane- and gasoline-powered school buses. Blue Bird, Ford and ROUSH CleanTech began working together in 2012. Since then, Blue Bird has deployed more than 40,000 alternative-fuel powered school buses.The demand for Blue Bird's propane-powered school buses has steadily increased over the past decade. Today's propane engine is 90 percent cleaner than the most stringent federal emission standard set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). New and even stricter emission standards will take effect in 2027. Blue Bird's near zero-emission, propane-powered school buses exceed those emission standards already today.""We are thrilled to extend our winning, long-standing collaboration with technology leaders Ford Motor Company and ROUSH CleanTech,"" said Britton Smith, president of Blue Bird Corporation. ""We are the only school bus manufacturer in the United States to bring an industry-leading portfolio of propane- and gasoline-powered buses to communities nationwide - and are excited for the opportunity to continue doing so for years to come. School districts and contractors seeking clean and cost-effective student transportation continue to find reliable solutions in Blue Bird.""""Our relationship with Blue Bird goes back nearly a century starting in 1927 when Blue Bird built its first school bus on a Ford chassis,"" said Douglas Chase, director of OEM sales at Ford Component Sales.

"Jul 29, 2024Ford Dealership by JeepersMedia / BY 2.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/)InvestingDoug McIntyre and Lee Jackson discuss the persistent underperformance of the Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) compared to competitors like GM (NYSE: GM) and Toyota. They attribute part of Ford’s struggles to its historical mismanagement by the founding family. Despite recent improvements and claims of significant growth in EV sales, Ford’s actual sales numbers are still relatively small. The conversation also touches on the skepticism around EVs, with many current EV owners indicating they might switch back to internal combustion engines. They suggest Ford should focus on its strengths rather than trying to pivot too aggressively into the EV market.Transcript:The Ford Motor Company cannot get out of its own way.It still is underperforming GM, Toyota for the year.And I mean, it’s underperformed the other stocks you can easily buy on one of the American exchanges now.It isn’t for, you know, a quarter year today.Why do people look at Ford and say, it’s just not as good as the other car companies?I mean, what’s the story?Well, for years, and you and I know from having lived where the Ford Motor Company is, it’s the family ran it and they were horrible.Same reason with the, they ran the Detroit Lions and they were horrible, but the minute they step aside, they tend to do better.But yeah, I mean, it’s a value trap because every time it gets going, you know, people say, hey, look at, you know, it pays the three and a half, 4% dividend and it’s, you know, it’s Ford and then they got the F-150 and then they always find a way to, you know, kind of shoot themselves in the foot and they get back to square one.Well, the thing that Ford talks about constantly is, you know, our EV sales were up by high double digits in the last month.But when you look at the numbers, it’s the thousands.It’s not, oh, they were up by 100,000.It’s they were up by a few thousand.Right.So it’s that old thing of, well, you know, it’s the rule of small numbers.You know, you and I can make anything look good if we sold one of something and then the next year we sold two.Right.It’s a little bit of a smokescreen when you say that you’re doing well in the EV business, but you still have tiny market share and tiny sales.Well, like you said, for them to sell thousands more, that’s a rounding error to a company like Ford.And their key products, and I’m sure you’ve seen the recent studies where 95% or not 95%, you know, 55, 60% of the people that currently have an EV have no intention of buying one again.You know, they’re just trying to work their way out of it and they’ll go back to a, you know, internal combustion engine.So they should continue to ride the wave of what’s worked, you know, like Daryl Roy used to say, dance to the one who brung you, or dance with the one that brung you, and that’s what we probably should focus on.By providing your email address, you agree to receive communications from us regarding website updates and other offerings that may be of interest to you.You have the option to opt-out of these emails at any moment.

- How The Development of Awaruite Deposits in Canada May Help
- Alleviate Projected Shortages of Nickel Concentrate

     FinancialNewsMedia.com News Commentary - The refining of sulfide
nickel deposits usually requires a smelting capacity not present in North
America. It is controlled by China. Smelting is an environmentally harmful
process worse than C02 that can cause environmental damage (water, air).
Tailings from sulphide minerals in mining waste have the potential to
create acid. China Controls 68-80% of nickel refining smelting, and
controls 84% of the Indonesia Nickel Market. A report from the Brookings
Institute said that: Even if the U.S. and EU were to dig more minerals out
of the ground, many of these minerals would need to be shipped overseas for
concentrating, refining, and smelting without significant increases in U.S.
and European mineral refining and smelting capacity. The U.S., in
particular, will likely have to update and amend its mining regulatory
regime. Governments will also have to onshore or friend-shore smelting and
refining capacity. The midstream part of the equation is likely to be the
most challenging, complicated by high investment costs and market
conditions. Active Companies mentioned in the article include: First
Atlantic Nickel Corp. (OTCQB: FANCF) (TSX-V: FAN), Alaska Energy Metals
Corporation (TSX-V: AEMC) (OTCQB: AKEMF), Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F),
General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM), TMC the metals company Inc. (NASDAQ: TMC).

     The U.S. Government (USGS) sees a better way saying: The development
of awaruite deposits in other parts of Canada may help alleviate any
prolonged shortage of nickel concentrate. Awaruite, a natural iron-nickel
alloy, is much easier to concentrate than pentlandite, the principal
sulfide of nickel. Awaruite is safer and more economical to process due to
the magnetic separation and concentration. It uses less chemicals, less
energy, can be processed directly in North America and since no smelting is
required doesnt need to go to China. Awaruite means no burning, which
releases sulfur dioxide and other toxic emissions, and less risk of acid
mine tailings accidents or contaminations (no sulphide minerals present).

     A report from Science Direct said: Nickel is an important component of
stainless steel and a wide range of applications which are critical for the
transition to clean energies including electric vehicle batteries. Awaruite
is a native nickeliron alloy that has gained interest as a possible new
economic source of nickel. In the last decades, there have been discoveries
of awaruite, mostly with more significant amounts of nickel sulphides, that
have demonstrated the potential for awaruite to contribute to the economics
of a deposit. This study is focused on the very large Baptiste deposit in
central British Columbia, Canada where awaruite is the primary nickel
mineral. It concluded: Awaruite has the potential to be concentrated in a
unique and valuable nickel concentrate of distinctive characteristics
including its very high nickel content, which lowers both the downstream
costs and the carbon intensity. Furthermore, the negligible content of
sulphur and penalty trace elements, such as mercury, antimony, and arsenic
in a potential awaruite concentrate, minimizes the costs of refining it.

     First Atlantic Nickel Corp. (OTCQB: FANCF) (TSX-V: FAN) Hosts
Strategic Investor Site Visit, Expands Geological Team, and Reports
Milestones on Infrastructure Upgrades at Atlantic Nickel Project - First
Atlantic Nickel Corp. (FSE: P21) (""First Atlantic"" or the ""Company"") is
pleased to provide an update on the progress at its wholly-owned Atlantic
Nickel Project in central Newfoundland, Canada (the ""Project"" or the
""Atlantic Nickel Project""). The Company recently completed the first site
visit with a strategic corporate investor (the ""Strategic Investor""), which
included examining nickel-bearing occurrences and historical drill core.
First Atlantic welcomes the Strategic Investor's support, knowledge, and
experience in mining project exploration and development.

     Highlights:

//st

  * First site visit at Atlantic Nickel Project with Corporate Strategic
Investor completed.
  * Awaruite identified as visible grains in previous drill core from
Atlantic Lake Area.
  * First bridge installed as part of road upgrade and development program,
enabling year-round Project access.
  * Technical Advisor, Dr. Ron Britten has conducted a site visit to
examine awaruite nickel occurrences and will help lead the charge to
discover a potential large scale deposit.
  * Permits filed for phase 2 of new all-weather road construction.
  * Geological team with awaruite experience expanded to accelerate
district-scale exploration efforts along extensive 30 km trend.

//et

     Project Road Update: First Atlantic is also pleased to announce the
installation of the first bridge as part of its infrastructure upgrade
program on the Project. The Company anticipates the completion of two
additional bridges, allowing for the establishment of operations directly
on the Project site, enhancing future operational efficiency.

     The installation of the first bridge marks a significant milestone in
conducting large-scale district-size mining exploration operations. The
road will provide faster and closer access to additional awaruite zones
throughout the district, allowing for year-round exploration work and
drilling. Improved road access reduces the cost per meter of drilling,
enabling significantly more drilling activities.

     Exploration Updates: Preparations are underway for the Exploration
Camp with a permit in place. The camp will serve as a strategic base for
on-site operations, enabling the exploration team to work efficiently in
the field. To ensure year-round access to the site, road upgrades are being
implemented, allowing for easy ground access regardless of the season.

     The exploration program is focusing on grading and prioritizing
awaruite outcrops, as well as sampling and mapping prospective drill
targets along the 30km trend. A LiDAR/Photos airborne program is also being
planned to aid in this work, providing high-resolution topographic data and
aerial imagery. The LiDAR data will help identify key geological
structures, while the aerial photos will be used to visually identify
outcrops for the geological team to investigate on the ground. This
integrated approach will further support exploration and development
efforts.

     Technical Advisor, Dr. Ron Britten, has completed an initial site
visit and is working closely with the First Atlantic exploration team
on-site. With his decades of experience, including discovering the Baptiste
awaruite deposit containing over 10 billion pounds of nickel, Dr. Britten
will enhance the program. Dr. Britten's efforts will help outline the best
occurrences for targeting in the initial drill program planned for this
year. This large-scale district sampling program can continue during the
road construction phase necessary for full drilling operations. CONTINUED

its parent company, GM Defense can help solve the DoD's energy and energy
storage challenges. The work performed in this new effort will provide
insights into the performance and design considerations when batteries are
used in more dynamic, high-power operations than would be faced by more
typical applications. OECIF support plays a key role in the development of
new power and energy technologies, which provide the DoD with advanced
capabilities and help prevent power and energy from being a limiting
factor.

     TMC the metals company Inc. (NASDAQ: TMC), an explorer of the worlds
largest estimated undeveloped source of critical battery metals, recently
announced that it has successfully produced the worlds first cobalt sulfate
derived exclusively from seafloor polymetallic nodules. The cobalt sulfate
was generated during bench-scale testing of TMCs hydrometallurgical
flowsheet design with SGS Canada Inc. (SGS). The test work was carried out
at SGS Metallurgical Centre of Excellence testing facility in Lakefield,
Ontario.

     Based on samples of nickel-cobalt-copper matte first produced by TMC
in 2021, the Extractive Metallurgy team at SGS tested TMCs efficient
flowsheet to process high-grade nickel-copper-cobalt matte directly to
high-purity cobalt sulfate without making cobalt metal, while producing
fertilizer byproducts instead of solid waste or tailings. This milestone
follows last months successful production of nickel sulfate, a key raw
material input used in the production of energy-dense electric vehicle
batteries.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the ""Class Period""). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was ""executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,"" asserted that ""our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,"" and that ""there's no doubt there's [been] better execution"" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused ""confusion"" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate ""execution strategy to scale"" the Company's AI-powered growth products ""to reach their full potential,"" and that AI had ""create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers."" Ui Path also described how the ""investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs"" while experiencing ""contract execution challenges on large deals.""This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring.

"NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 28, 2024 / Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP (""BFA"") announces that it has filed a class action lawsuit for violations of the federal securities laws against CAE Inc. (""CAE"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE:CAE) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered a loss on your CAE investment, please submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases/cae-inc-investigation.The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in CAE who purchased or acquired CAE stock on an exchange in the United States between February 11, 2022 and May 21, 2024 inclusive (the ""Class Period""). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Norbert Gamache v. CAE Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05360. A copy of the lawsuit can be found here: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/CAEComplaint.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning significant cost overruns in CAE's Defense and Security (""Defense"") segment caused by several fixed-price, long-term Defense contracts entered prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and ""re-baselin[e]"" its entire Defense business.On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts. On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $4.32 per share, or more than 16%, from $25.80 per share on August 9, 2022, to $21.48 per share on August 10, 2022.Defendants, however, continued to make false representations regarding the strength of the Defense segment. For instance, the Company assured investors that ""[n]otwithstanding the additional volatility"" from ""acute short-term headwinds for the Defense sector, management maintains a highly positive view of its growth potential over a multi-year period.""On November 14, 2023, CAE stated that certain legacy contracts continued to be plagued by cost overruns. CAE revealed that, within the Defense segment, the Company planned to ""retir[e] legacy contracts, which have been most affected by inflationary pressures."" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $0.85 per share, or nearly 4%, from $21.92 per share on November 13, 2023, to $21.07 per share on November 14, 2023.Three months later, on February 14, 2024, CAE announced that it ""sought to further accelerate the retirement of outstanding program risks, mainly associated with certain legacy Defense contracts that we entered into pre-COVID and have been most impacted by economic headwinds."" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $2.01 per share, or nearly 10%, from $20.92 per share on February 13, 2024, to $18.91 per share on February 14, 2024.Finally, after the close of trading on May 21, 2024, CAE announced a ""re-baselining of its Defense business, Defense impairments, [and] accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts."" The Company stated that ""CAE has recorded a $568.0 million non-cash impairment of Defense goodwill,"" ""$90.3 million in unfavorable Defense contract profit adjustments as a result of accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts,"" and a ""$35.7 million impairment of related technology and other non-financial assets which are principally related to the Legacy Contracts."" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $1.03 per share, or more than 5%, from $19.83 per share on May 21, 2024, to $18.80 per share on May 22, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/cae-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in CAE, Inc. you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

Video Transcript:
Mercedes-Benz has capped a tough week for big automakers. The German giant on Friday cut profit forecasts, after weak sales and earnings in the second quarter. Like rivals, it's battling headwinds including lackluster demand for EVs and mounting competition in China. Supply bottlenecks and high interest rates also remain a drag. Mercedes reported a 6% drop in sales for the first half, and a 17% plunge in sales of electric cars. The company said it now had a cautious view on China, where it expects fierce competition, particularly for its cheaper products. It was more hopeful about prospects in Europe, and said it saw solid momentum in the US. Mercedes shares fell as much as 1.4% in early European trade following the news, but later recovered to trade flat. The wary outlook added to a tough week for the industry. Earlier, Japan's Nissan reported a 99% plunge in its first-quarter profit, after it was forced to do big discounts in the US. Ford shares tumbled 13% after it missed forecasts, citing quality-related problems and competition in the EV market. And Tesla stock sank too, after it also missed forecasts and saw profit margins sink to a five-year low.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

"Jul 26, 2024 24/7 Wall St. InsightsFord Motor Co. (NYSE: F) earnings upset Wall Street. The day after they were released, the stock was down 19% at one point, and it closed down just over 18%. It was an extraordinary crash for a public corporation whose earnings initially seemed reasonably good. The plunge was the worst since 2008.Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F) stock retreated nearly 20% following its earnings report.High warranty expenses and losses on EVs troubled investors.Also: 2 Dividend Legends to Hold ForeverWhat happened? Ford posted an earnings drop of 26% from the same quarter in 2023. Earnings for the recent quarter totaled $2.8 billion. Unfortunately, analysts expected the figure to be $3.7 billion.Investors were troubled by high warranty expenses. Ford Blue, the division that makes gasoline-powered cars, had an operating income of $1.2 billion. Warranty expenses for the quarter were $2 billion, which was $800 million worse than the prior quarter. “Warranty has been a growing issue at Ford over the last five years and has escalated over the past year,” Freedom Capital Markets analyst Mike Ward wrote in a report on the numbers.Another deeply troubling development was that Ford Model e, the electric vehicle (EV) part of the company’s operations, lost $1.1 billion. That shows how badly Ford’s investment in this sector has gone. EV rival Tesla had a weak second quarter but had a net income of $1.5 billion.Why did Ford’s stock drop even though it had reasonable profits? Everything else about the company’s numbers was awful.See the Top 10 EV Brands Right Now“The Next NVIDIA” Could Change Your LifeIf you missed out on NVIDIA’s historic run, your chance to see life-changing profits from AI isn’t over.The 24/7 Wall Street Analyst who first called NVIDIA’s AI-fueled rise in 2009 just published a brand-new research report named “The Next NVIDIA.”Click here to download your FREE copy.The post Ford Stock Plunges Almost 20% on Earnings appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the ""Newstex Authoritative Content"") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Description: The Dow Jones Industrial Average hung onto early gains to close higher on stronger-than-expected U.S. gross domestic product data. Lisa Bernhard has more.
Short Link: https://refini.tv/3WnVRrZ
Video Transcript:
The S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ ended a bumpy session weaker on Thursday, failing to regain ground lost in the previous day's tech-triggered sell-off. The Dow added 0.20%, the S&amp;P lost 0.50%, and the NASDAQ fell more than 0.90%. All three indexes were up for most of the session on the heels of stronger-than-expected second quarter GDP data. Mega-cap stocks traded higher mid-afternoon, only to fall later in the day, with Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and NVIDIA all ending lower. Lackluster earnings from both Tesla and Alphabet had pummeled Magnificent Seven stocks a day earlier, causing the S&amp;P and NASDAQ to log their worst day since 2022. Alphabet's shares dipped again on Thursday, falling 3% to the stock's lowest close since May 6. But Tesla rebounded 2%. Four more mega-cap tech companies report earnings next week. But while Brad Bernstein, Managing Director at UBS Private Wealth Management, called their results ""critical"", it's the rest of the market he's excited about.
So, we actually think the big story in earnings season this month will be the fact that for the first time in two years, we're going to have earnings growth in the non-Magnificent Seven of the S&amp;P 500. So, the 493 other stocks that have had no earnings growth as collectively over the last several years are finally going to have earnings growth. And we think that bodes very well for the rally to continue because earnings are now growing from other areas within the market.
Among earnings-driven moves, IBM shares jumped more than 4% after the tech company beat estimates for second quarter revenue and raised the annual growth forecast for its software business. Shares of American Airlines rose more than 4% after the company said it had taken swift action to reset its sales and distribution strategy which had driven away corporate travelers. Meanwhile, shares of Southwest Airlines climbed 5.5% after saying it would end open seating on its flights. On the flip side, Ford shares plummeted more than 18% after the automaker's second quarter adjusted profit missed estimates by a wide margin.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

Description: Automakers Ford and General Motors, together worth $95 bln, have hit some nasty bumps in the road. But pop the hood, and their financial engines are humming nicely. Despite fears over vehicle prices, there are plenty of reasons to expect that to continue, Jonathan Guilford says.
Short Link: https://refini.tv/3SotwR5
Video Transcript:
Detroit shock absorbers look strong enough to withstand some nasty bumps. Ford Motor and General Motors both spooked investors after unveiling their latest financial results this week. Look closer, though, and the two automakers are, for the most part, humming along. Ford's operating profit unexpectedly crashed 27% in the second quarter, sending shares plummeting. The shock result is tied to the Motor City company's perennial quality-control issues, a top priority for boss Jim Farley. Costs at its internal-combustion unit spiked $1.4 billion year-over-year, mostly as a result of warranty claims for vehicles from 2021 or earlier. Rival GM unveiled far stronger results. But amid warnings about competition in China and a longer path to reaching profitability on its electric models, it lost nearly $4 billion of market value nevertheless. Step back, and there's a bigger overall concern: pricing. Thanks to a supply-constrained market, markups on, say, Chevy Silverados or Cadillac Escalades have contributed an average near $1.4 billion boost to GM's quarterly operating profit since the start of 2020. Such uplifts tallied $500 million combined year-over-year for GM and Ford between April and June. Both companies have cautiously signaled that this pricing power will eventually ebb. After all, nearly 6% of auto loans to customers with weaker credit scores were at least 60 days overdue in June, per Fitch Ratings, twice 2021's rate. While more cars are piling up in dealer inventories, dealers are feeling the pinch with gross margins on new vehicles falling from recent highs. Yet Ford and GM could reasonably see scope to eat further into dealers' profitability, which was turbo-charged by post COVID-19 price-hiking before they take any hit themselves. Americans, meanwhile, are overdue some upgrades. The average passenger car is 14 years old, S&amp;P Global said in May, up from 11 years in 2012. With traders now pricing in rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve, they'll likely be able to get cheaper loans soon, too. These reinforced guardrails should keep the Motown duo on the right track.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

Description: Wall Street rebounded in afternoon trading, with the S&amp;P 500 index reversing early losses. The Dow and small-cap stocks outperformed after U.S. economic growth regained steam in the second quarter. Traders await the PCE price index due out Friday.
Short Link: https://refini.tv/4cY0ik8
Video Transcript:
Stronger-than-expected GDP fails to dampen rate cut expectations out of PCE data out on Friday. Welcome to US Markets Briefing. I'm Peter Devlin. The much-awaited PCE Price Index is set for release tomorrow. Analysts polled by Reuters expect the core reading to have risen 0.1% in June for a second straight month and the year-on-year rate to fall to 2.5%. Data today showed that US economy expanded 2.8% in the second quarter versus an estimate of 2%, but price pressures did subside. Treasury yields were mostly lower after the release. Market expectations of a September Fed rate cut remained intact. But one analyst we spoke to said tomorrow's data will do little on how aggressive the Fed will cut rates.
I'm not expecting a big downside surprise to core PCE tomorrow, which would really change the calculus for the Fed. So now, that we have CPI and PPI, it's really easy to leg into what tomorrow's print is going to be. And it's going to show progress, but just not enough progress to be a little bit more aggressive on the rate cutting front.
Wall Street rebounded in afternoon trading, with the S&amp;P reversing early losses. The Dow outperformed, led higher by IBM's second-quarter revenue topping estimates. The upbeat GDP data helped the Dollar stay resilient. Small caps also benefited. The Russell 2000 jumped 2%, that's on track to fully recoup their losses from Wednesday's broad sell-off. The Russell has surged over the past weeks, as investors rotate out of pricier tech stocks. So, looking to the major market movers in the session, Ford shares had their worst drop in four years, last time 16.5%. The Detroit automaker suffered a major miss on earnings. That was blamed on a surge on warranty report costs for older vehicles. Shares of Honeywell tumbled lower by 4.4%. The industrial conglomerate lowered its annual profit forecast due to lower demand in its industrial automation business. And shares of media giant Warner Bros. Discovery were down 5.3% on check. The company's efforts to renew NBA broadcasting rights was spurned, ending a 40-year-long partnership. So meanwhile, major companies will continue to report their second-quarter earnings in pre-market trading tomorrow. Starting with Bristol-Myers Squibb, and markets are awaiting updates on $1.5 billion worth of cost savings in its program. Colgate-Palmolive is expected to post a slight rise in revenue. It abides steady demand for its product categories such as self-care and pet nutrition. And finally, Charter Communications is expected to post a rise in revenue. The telecommunications company has seen steady subscriber growth for its rural expansion plans. Like Wall Street, oil markets also saw topsy-turvy trading, prices reversed earlier losses, and Brent is now above $82 and WTI is over $78, following the US GDP numbers. That is your US Markets Briefing.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

"NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 25, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces it has filed a lawsuit against UiPath, Inc. (""UiPath"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE:PATH) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your UiPath investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.Investors have until August 19, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the ""Class Period""). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was ""executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,"" asserted that ""our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,"" and that ""there's no doubt there's [been] better execution"" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused ""confusion"" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate ""execution strategy to scale"" the Company's AI-powered growth products ""to reach their full potential,"" and that AI had ""create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers."" Ui Path also described how the ""investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs"" while experiencing ""contract execution challenges on large deals.""This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

"NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 25, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces a lawsuit has been filed against MongoDB, Inc. (Nasdaq:MDB) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your MongoDB investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.Investors have until September 9, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and ""re-baselin[e]"" its entire Defense business.On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts.

Description: Data showed the US economy grew faster than expected in the second quarter, lending some support to market sentiment after Wednesday's sharp selloff for tech stocks.
Short Link: https://refini.tv/3WDrTRS
Video Transcript:
US second-quarter GDP surprises to the upside. Welcome to Trading at Noon. I am Thomas Warner. Data showed the US economy grew faster than expected in the second quarter. Annualized growth of 2.8% came in well above estimates of 2.0%. But inflation, as measured by the Core PCE Price Index, subsided, leaving expectations of a September rate cut intact. Separate report showed weekly jobless claims fell more than expected as distortions from the weather and temporary automobile plant closures faded. Turning to the equity markets now, and the main US indexes opening mixed, with the S&amp;P and NASDAQ dipping in and out of positive territory. This after the NASDAQ suffered its worst day since 2022 on Wednesday. Investors assessed stronger-than-expected GDP data but remained cautious after suffering that tech mauling in the previous session. US Treasury yields, meanwhile, fell for a third day on Thursday as investors piled into shorter-dated bonds in anticipation of rate cuts. The global sell-off in tech stocks and other risk assets also fanned the push into safe haven assets. The gap between 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields hits its narrowest since October 2023 and was just a whisker below where it was in July 2022. In outright terms, NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Apple were among this morning's heaviest fallers on the S&amp;P 500. NVIDIA is down nearly 16% from its all-time high back in June. Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon all also traded lower. But Tesla bucked the trend, up 3% after its worst day in nearly four years yesterday. One analyst that we spoke to said that traders are reassessing the entire sector.
I think there is some caution. Obviously, Alphabet did beat expectations but not by enough to create upward momentum in the stock. And Tesla had a pretty broad-based miss. But ultimately, I think there is a questioning of traders of how much more money is going to be needed to invest in AI and when is that pay-off ultimately going to play out.
Outside of the mega caps, Ford Motors was down more than 17% at last check, after its second-quarter profit missed analyst expectations overnight. The automaker has been weighed down by its underperforming electric vehicle business. IBM shares moved the other way, gaining after the IT giant raised the forecast for its software business. It sees clients continuing to spend more on AI. US aerospace and defense company RTX, formally known Raytheon, raised its full-year earnings forecast and beat estimates for second-quarter profit. It has been boosted by the rebound in commercial aviation. Its stock was up 8% to an all-time high. Warner Bros. Discovery shares fell, meanwhile, on news that the company's networks have lost the rights to the NBA, ending a 40-year relationship. Walt Disney's ESPN, Comcast-owned NBCUniversal, and Amazon.com have clinched the rights instead. And that is Trading at Noon.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

Description: A global rout in tech stocks sent European markets down across the board, while quarterly results from Stellantis, Renault and Kering also disappointed. On Friday's calendar are Mercedes-Benz, BASF and NatWest.

Video Transcript:
European shares tumble amid a global tech stock rout. Welcome to your Europe Markets Briefing. I am Elena Casas. The STOXX 600 is set for its worst day in over three months. The tech sector sank after a sell-off in US mega caps triggered by poor results from Tesla. Big European names also reported disappointing numbers. Stellantis and Renault both lost over 8% on the back of weak quarterly results, while luxury goods giant Kering fell 7.6% after a bigger-than-expected drop in second-quarter sales. Companies in the Eurozone's two biggest economies are growing more pessimistic, business surveys showed today. In Germany, the Ifo Business Climate Index fell for a fourth straight month. While in France, manufacturers said demand from abroad was weakening and morale in the services sector hit its worst level in more than three years. As President Macron welcomes business leaders to Paris ahead of tomorrow's Olympics, travel firms and airlines have been complaining that tourists are staying away. One strategist told us earlier that the latest economic projections for the Eurozone could turn out to be too optimistic.
Question marks about global growth will prove to be problematic for the Eurozone. So, we have seen those forward-looking survey indicators retreating quite significantly. Expectations within the Ifo survey dipped below the current reading, and that is a rather negative backdrop. So, I think that does suggest that the Euro macroeconomic projections are going to be challenged.
Well, after a fall in Lloyds' profits got UK bank earnings off to a weak start this morning, NatWest is up on Friday. The Conservative government was planning a major public share sale to reduce its 21% stake, but Labour has yet to announce its own plans. Stated pre-tax profits is expected to have dropped to GBP5.1 billion, down by nearly a sixth as interest income falls. Also, up tomorrow is Mercedes-Benz, after weak numbers from Stellantis, Ford, and Nissan today raised fears of a wider slowdown across the car industry. Also reporting are chemicals giant BASF and cement manufacturer Holcim. And flights were halted at Frankfurt Airport this morning after six climate change activists blocked runways by gluing themselves to the tarmac. The protestors were part of a Europe-wide wave of action that also disrupted airports in Switzerland and Norway this morning. While seven Just Stop Oil members were arrested at Heathrow.

"Shares of Ford Motor Co. are tumbling Thursday after the automaker's second-quarter adjusted profit badly missed Wall Street's expectations as it spent more money fixing customers' cars and trucks.Late Wednesday Ford reported an adjusted profit of 47 cents per share. That was far short of industry analysts' estimates of 68 cents, according to FactSet.Warranty costs have vexed the nation's second-largest automaker for several years and lopped billions off of its profits. In the second quarter, warranty and recall costs totaled $2.3 billion, $800 million more than the first quarter and $700 million more than a year ago.Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan said in an analyst note that the weaker-than-expected quarterly profit was surprising, particularly when General Motors reported a strong performance a day earlier. Brinkman outpointed that warranty costs were the culprit at Ford, which were above his expectation for flat to lower costs sequentially.""Ford management believes its initial quality on newly built vehicles has since improved, implying stronger-than-might appear current-period execution and lower future-period warranty expense, although we do not expect investors to give Ford a pass, including given the automaker has intermittently struggled with higher repair costs for coming on several years,"" he wrote.Shares slid nearly 17% in midday trading.Copyright © 2024 The Associated Press.

"Jul 25, 2024Toa55 / iStock via Getty ImagesInvesting24/7 Wall St. InsightsMost of the blame for the big hit to Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F) stock falls on CEO Jim Farley.The company faces poor electric vehicle sales and poor product quality issues.Also: 2 Dividend Legends to Hold ForeverFord Motor Co. (NYSE: F) stock took a huge hit, and Jim Farley, Ford’s CEO since October 2020, gets most of the blame. First, his attempt to move into electric vehicles (EVs) cost the number two U.S. car company billions in losses. Now, poor product quality has cost Ford billions of dollars in warranty costs. Farley promised almost two years ago that the warranty problem would be fixed. The company has made some progress with poor vehicle quality, but not enough. It ranked 17th out of 34 in the recent Consumer Reports annual report on brand quality.Ford’s adjusted per-share earnings came in at $0.47, against a consensus estimate of $0.68, a massive miss. Revenue was $44.81 billion, against expectations of $44.02 billion. Most of the warranty problems are for models from 2021 and early. However, those problems linger.Ford Chief Financial Officer John Lawler said, “We’re making real progress on quality that will benefit us down the road.” That was not enough to tame angry investors, who sold the stock down over 12% after hours after a 1% dip during the trading day.Ford’s stock has traded flat for the past two years, when the recent sell-off was considered. The S&amp;P 500 is up 36% over the same period, and shares of rival General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM) are about 34% higher.Over time, more than warranties have weighed on Ford’s poor stock performance. Management said in 2021 that it would invest $30 billion in EVs between 2021 and 2025. What it has for that is monthly sales of EVs in the tens of thousands. Sales of its EV flagship F-150 Lightning, the electric version of the most popular vehicle in the United States, have been terrible. Ford sold 7,902 of these in the second quarter.Farley has not turned Ford around. If anything, he has put the company in reverse.∴By providing your email address, you agree to receive communications from us regarding website updates and other offerings that may be of interest to you.You have the option to opt-out of these emails at any moment.

"DETROIT (AP) — In October of 2020, Ford's then-new CEO Jim Farley said the company was working to cut warranty costs after glitch-prone small-car transmissions hit the automaker's bottom line.Nearly four years later, warranty costs are still vexing the nation's second-largest automaker and lopping billions off of its profits.Ford Motor Co. reported Wednesday that its second-quarter net income fell 4.7% from a year ago as its combustion-engine unit posted a pretax loss due to rising warranty and recall costs.The profit drop and lingering quality problems knocked net income to $1.83 billion from April through June, compared with $1.92 billion a year ago. It caused Ford to badly miss Wall Street estimates for adjusted earnings per share, touching off a stock plunge in after-hours trading.Warranty and recall costs last quarter, the company said, totaled $2.3 billion, $800 million more than the first quarter and $700 million more than a year ago.At its investor day event two years ago, Farley said Ford had made progress on quality of new vehicles as well as initial quality after vehicles were sold. ""However we are not satisfied at all with our quality performance, including our recalls and customer satisfaction efforts, which we need to quickly accelerate,"" he said at the time.Chief Financial Officer John Lawler told reporters Wednesday that Ford is making progress on quality. The second-quarter costs were attributed to older vehicles from the 2021 model year and earlier.Farley told analysts that improvements are showing up in internal data, and in research by J.D. Power, which found that Ford rose 14 places in this year's initial quality survey, from 23rd to ninth.Lower warranty costs, Lawler said, lag 12 to 18 months behind quality improvements, and that's when lower costs should start to show up.Farley said many of the problems should have been caught before the older vehicles were put on sale. Now, the company is holding vehicles until it works out problems. ""We do not release them until we're happy with the quality and that we've done all the testing,"" he said. ""And it makes our quarters lumpy, and it's challenging, but it will reduce warranty over time.""Second-quarter warranty costs rose due to new technology, recalls and inflationary pressures that pushed up the costs of repair, Farley said. The company soon will be able to predict problems and potentially fix them with online software updates before bigger problems arise, he said.The profit drop and warranty costs from April through June did not sit well with investors.Shares of Ford, which had grown about 12% this year as of Wednesday's market closing, plunged in extended trading during the evening, nearly erasing a year's worth of gains.Excluding one-time items, Ford made 47 cents per share. That was far short of industry analysts' estimates of 68 cents, according to FactSet.The automaker reported $47.8 billion in revenue for the quarter, a 6.3% increase over the $44.95 billion in the second quarter of 2023. That barely beat analyst estimates of $47.79 billion.Ford Blue, the company's internal-combustion-engine unit, made $1.17 billion before taxes during the quarter, down $1.1 billion from a year earlier. Ford Pro, the commercial vehicle unit, made $2.56 billion, $173 million above 2023. Model e, the electric vehicle unit, lost $1.14 billion, $63 million worse than a year ago.Despite the net profit drop, Ford held its full year guidance for pretax income at $10 billion to $12 billion.Asked by analyst if Ford's stock is still a good value, Farley said it is, pointing to its highly profitable commercial-vehicle business and new high-margin opportunities from increased service and software revenue.""I think people will understand over time how many exciting opportunities there are for Ford, and I'm not just referring to vehicles,"" Farley said. ""I'm referring to non-vehicle activities.""A not-so-small team in California, he said, is working on a new electric vehicle platform that will yield lower-cost and profitable smaller EVs. The team, he said, has designed EVs and parts that are better and cheaper than competitors. He said the company is working on partnerships that will play out in larger vehicles. It is benchmarking Tesla and Chinese automakers on EV costs, he said.Ford's second-quarter sales in the U.S., its most lucrative market, rose just under 1% to more than 532,000 vehicles.Lawler said Ford is on track to cut $2 billion from material, manufacturing and freight expenses this year, which will be partly offset by higher labor and vehicle update costs.___This story has been updated to correct the date Ford CEO Jim Farley made comments about vehicle quality at a company investor day to 2022 instead of 2020. It was also updated correct the headline to read that Ford's combustion engine unit's pretax profit dropped but it did not post a loss.Copyright © 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, Senator Ben Carden, Minority Leader Hakim Jeffries, Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer, Senate Minority leader Mitch McConnell, Senators, members of Congress, distinguished guests. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you for giving me the profound honor of addressing this great citadel of democracy for the fourth time. We meet today at a crossroads of history. Our world is in upheaval. In the Middle East, Iran's axis of terror confronts America, Israel, and our Arab friends. This is not a clash of civilizations. It's a clash between barbarism and civilization. It's a clash between those who glorify death and those who sanctify life. For the forces of civilization to triumph, America and Israel must stand together. Because when we stand together, something very simple happens. We win, they lose. And my friends, I came to assure you today of one thing. We will win. Ladies and gentlemen, like December 7, 1941, and September 11, 2001, October 7 is a day that will forever live in infamy. It was the Jewish holiday of [inaudible 00:19:35]. It began as a perfect day, not a cloud in the sky. Thousands of young Israelis were celebrating at an outdoor music festival. And suddenly at 6:29 AM as children were still sleeping soundly in their beds in the towns in Kibbutzim next to Gaza, suddenly, heaven turned into hell. 3,000 Hamas terrorists stormed into Israel. They butchered 1,200 people from 41 countries, including 39 Americans. Proportionately, compared to our population size. That's like 29 11s in one day. And these monsters, they rape women, they beheaded men, they burn babies alive. They killed parents in front of their children, and children in front of their parents. They dragged 255 people, both living and dead into the dark dungeons of Gaza. Israel has already brought home 135 of these hostages, including seven who were freed in daring rescue operations. One of those freed hostages, Noa Argamani, is here in the gallery, sitting near my wife, Sarah. On the morning of October 7, the entire world saw Noa's look of desperation as she was violently abducted to Gaza on the back of a motorcycle. I met Noa's mother Leora a few months ago. She was dying of cancer. She said to me, Prime Minister, I have one final wish. I wish to hug my daughter, Noa, one last time before I die. Two months ago, I authorized a breathtaking commander rescue operation. Our special forces, including a heroic officer named Arnonz Mora, who fell in this battle, rescued Noa and three other hostages. Noa, I think it's one of the most moving things. When Noa was reunited with her mother Leora, and her mother's last wish came true. Noa, we're so thrilled to have you with us today. Thank you. Many hostage families are also here with us today, including Elial Bibas. Elial Bibas is the grandfather of those two beautiful, redheaded boys, the Bibas boys, toddlers. And they were taken hostage with their mother and Elial's son. The entire family was taken hostage. Two beautiful red haired children. Taken hostage. What monsters? And with us also is Iris Kaim whose son Yotam bravely escaped Hamas captivity with two other Israelis. And tragically, they were killed, making their way back to our lines. We have with us also the families of American hostages. They're here. The pain these families have endured is beyond words. I met with them again yesterday, and I promised them this. I will not rest until all their loved ones are home. All of them. As we speak, we're actively engaged in intensive efforts to secure their release. And I'm confident that these efforts can succeed. Some of them are taking place right now. I want to thank President Biden for his tireless efforts on behalf of the hostages and for his efforts to the hostage families, as well. I thank President Biden for his heartfelt support for Israel. After the savage attack on October 7, he rightly called Hamas sheer evil. He dispatched two aircraft carriers to the Middle East to deter a wider war. And he came to Israel to stand with us during our darkest hour, a visit that will never be forgotten. President Biden and I have known each other for over 40 years. I want to thank him for half a century of friendship to Israel, and for being, as he says, a proud Zionist, actually, he says, a proud Irish American Zionist. My friends, for more than nine months, Israel's soldiers have shown boundless courage. With us today is Lieutenant Avichal Rueven. Avichal is an officer in the Israeli paratroopers. His family immigrated to Israel from Ethiopia. In the early hours of October 7, Abigail heard the news of Hamas's bloody rampage. He put on his uniform, grabbed his rifle, but he didn't have a car. So he ran eight miles to the front lines of Gaza to defend his people. You hear that? He ran eight miles, came to the front lines, killed many terrorists and saved many lives. Avichal, we all honor your remarkable heroism. Another Israeli is with us here today, and he's standing. Stand up right next to right next to Avichal. This is Master Sergeant Ashraf Fal Bakeri. Ashraf is a veteran soldier from the Israeli Muslim community of Rods. On October 7, Ashraf too killed many terrorists. First, he defended his comrades in the military base, and he then rushed to defend the neighboring communities, including the devastated community of Kibbutz Be'eri. Like Ashraf, the Muslim soldiers of the IDF fought alongside their Jewish Drews, Christian, and other comrades in arms with tremendous bravery. A third hero, Lieutenant Asa Soper is also here with us. Asa fought as an officer in the tank corps. And he was wounded in battle. He was wounded in battle, while protecting his fellow soldiers from a grenade. He lost his right arm, and the vision in his left eye. He's recovering, and incredibly, within a short time, Asa will soon return to active duty as a commander of a tank company. I just learned there is a fourth hero here, Lieutenant Yantan Jonathan Benham, who lost a leg in Gaza and continued to fight. My friends these are the soldiers of Israel, unbowd, undaunted, unafraid. As the Bible says, Am kv Yaku, they shall rise like lions. They have risen like lions, the lions of Judah, the lions of Israel. Ladies and gentlemen, the men and women of the IDF come from every corner of Israeli societies. Every ethnicity, every color, every crete, left and right, religious and secular. All are imbued with the indomitable spirit of the Macabes, the legendary Jewish warriors of antiquity. With us today is Yehel Lighter, the father of one of those Macabes. Yehel's father escaped the Holocaust and found refuge in America. As a young man, Yehel moved to Israel and raised a family of eight children. He named his eldest son, Moshe, after his late father. Moshe became an exemplary officer in one of our elite commander units. He served with distinction for two decades while raising six beautiful children of his own. On October 7th, Moshe volunteered to return to combat. Four weeks later, he was killed when a booby trapped mine exploded in a tunnel shaft right next to a mosque. At his son's funeral, Yehel said this. If the state of Israel had not been established after the Holocaust, the image engraved in our collective memory would have been the photograph of that helpless Jewish boy in the Warsaw Ghetto holding his hands up in the air with Nazi rifles pointed at him. But because of the birth of Israel, Yehel continued, Because of the courage of soldiers like my son Moshe, the Jewish people are no longer helpless in the face of our enemies. Yehel, please rise so we can honor your son's sacrifice, and I pledge to you and to all the bereaved families of Israel, some of who are in this hall today, the sacrifice of your loved ones will not be in vain. It will not be a vain because for Israel, never again must never be an empty promise. It was always remain a sacred vow. And after October 7th, never again is now. My friends defeating our brutal enemies requires both courage and clarity. Clarity begins by knowing the difference between good and evil. Yet incredibly, many anti Israel protesters, many choose to stand with evil. They stand with Hamas. They stand with rapists and murderers. They stand with people who came into the Kitim into a home. The parents hit the children, the two babies in the attic in a secret attic. They murder the families, the parents. They find the secret latch to the hidden attic, and then they murder the babies. These protessors stand with them. They should be ashamed of themselves. They refused to make the simple distinction between those who target terrorists and those who target civilians, between the Democratic state of Israel and the terrorist of Hamas. We recently learned from the National Security Director, US Director of National Intelligence, that Iran is funding and promoting anti Israel protests in America. They want to disrupt America. So these protesters burn American flags even on 4th July. And I wish to salute the fraternity brothers at the University of North Carolina who protected the American flag against these anti Israel protesters. For all we know, Iran is funding the anti Israel protests that are going on right now outside this building. Not that many, but they're there, and throughout the city. Well, I have a message for these protesters. When the tyrants of Tehran who hang gas from cranes and murder women for not air appraising, promoting, and funding you, you have officially become Iran's useful idiots. Some of these protesters. And it's amazing. Absolutely amazing. Some of these protesters hold up signs proclaiming gas for Gaza. They might as well hold up signs saying, chickens for KFC. These protesters chant from the river to the sea. But many don't have a clue what river and what sea they're talking about. They not only get an F in geography, they get an F in history. They call Israel. They call Israel a colonialist state. Don't they know that the land of Israel is where Ibrahim, Isaac, and Jacob prayed, where Isaiah and Jeremiah preached, and where David and Solomon rule for nearly 4,000 years, The land of Israel has been the homeland of the Jewish people. It's always been our home. It will always be our home. It's not only the campus protesters who get it wrong. It's also the people who run those campuses, 80 years after the Holocaust. The Presidents of Harvard, Penn, and I'm ashamed to say my Alma Mater, MIT, couldn't bring themselves to condemn the calls for the Genocide of Jews. Do you remember what they said? They said it depends on the context. Well, let me give these befuddled academics a little context. Anti semitism is the world's oldest hatred. For centuries, the massacre of Jews was always preceded by wild accusations. We were accused of everything from poisoning wills to spreading plagues, to using the blood of slaughtered children to bake passover mazas. These preposterous anti semitic lies led to persecution, mass murder, and ultimately to history's worst genocide, the Holocaust. Now, just as malicious lies were leveled for centuries at the Jewish people, malicious lies are now being leveled at the Jewish state. No, don't applaud. Listen. The outrageous slanders that paint Israel as racist and genocidal are meant to delegitimize Israel, to demonize the Jewish state, and to demonize Jews everywhere. And no wonder we've witnessed an appalling rise of anti semitism in America and around the world. My friends, whenever and wherever we see the scourge of anti semitism, we must unequivocally condemn it and resolutely fight it without exception. And don't be fooled when the blood libels against the Jewish State come from people who wear fancy silk robes and speak in lofty tones about law and justice. Here's a case in point. The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has shamefully accused Israel of deliberately starving the people of Gaza. This is utter complete nonsense. It's a complete fabrication. Israel has enabled more than 40,008 trucks to enter Gaza. That's half a million tons of food, and that's more than 3,000 calories for every man, woman, and child in Gaza. If there are Palestinians in Gaza who aren't getting enough food, it's not because Israel is blocking it. It's because Hamas is stealing it. So much for that lie, but here's another. The ICC prosecutor accuses Israel of deliberately targeting civilians. What in God's green Earth is he talking about? The IDF has dropped millions of fliers, sent millions of text messages, made hundreds of thousands of phone calls to get Palestinian civilians out of Hamas way. But at the same time, Hamas does everything in its power to put Palestinian civilians in harm's way. They fire rockets from schools, from hospitals, from mosques. They even shoot their own people when they try to leave the war zone. A senior Hamas official Patri Hamad boasted. Listen to this. He boasted that Palestinian women and children excel at being human shields. His words, Excel at being human shields. What monstrous evil? For Israel, every civilian death is a tragedy. For Hamas, it's a strategy. They actually want Palestinian civilians to die so that Israel will be smeared in the international media and be pressured to end the war before it's won. This would enable Hamas to survive another day, and as they vowed to carry out October 7th again and again. Well, I want to assure you, no matter what pressure is brought to bear, I will never allow that to happen. The vast majority of Americans have not fallen for this Hamas propaganda, they continue to support Israel. And I want to say, thank you, America, and thank you, senators and house members who continue to support us, continue to support Israel, continue to support the truth, and see through the lies. But as for the minority that may have fallen for Hamas Khan's job, I suggest you listen to Colonel John Spencer. John Spencer is head of Urban Warfare studies at West Point. He studied every major urban conflict, I was going to say in modern history. He corrected me, no, in history. Israel, he said, has implemented more precautions to prevent civilian harm than any military in history and beyond what international law requires. [APPLAUSE] That's why despite all the lies you've heard, the war in Gaza has one of the lowest ratios of combatants to non combatants casualties in the history of urban warfare. And you want to know where it's lowest in Gaza? It's lowest in Rafah. Remember what so many people said, if Israel goes into Rafah, there'd be thousands, maybe even 10s of thousands of civilians killed. Well, last week, I went into Rafah, I visited our troops as they finished fighting Hamas' remaining terrorist battalions. I asked the commander there , how many terrorists did you take out in Rafah? He gave me an exact number, 1,203. I asked him how many civilians were killed? He said, prime minister, practically none with the exception of a single incident where Shrapnel from a bomb hit a Hamas weapons depot and unintentionally killed two dozen people. The answer is, practically none. You want to know why? Because Israel got the civilians out of harm's way, something people said we could never do, but we did it. [APPLAUSE] These heroes here today, the heroic soldiers of Israel should not be condemned for how they're conducting the war in Gaza, they should be commended for it.[APPLAUSE] I want to thank all of you here today who have forcefully opposed the false accusations of the ICC and stood up for the truth. These lies are not only libelous , they're downright dangerous. The ICC is trying to shackle Israel's hands and prevent us from defending ourselves. And if Israel's hands are tied, America is next and I'll tell you what else is next. The ability of all democracies to fight terrorism will be imperlled. That's what's on the line. So let me assure you, the hands of the Jewish state will never be shackled, Israel will always defend itself. My friends in the Middle East, Iran is virtually beyond behind all the terrorism, all the turmoil, all the chaos, all the killing and that should come as no surprise. When he founded the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini pledged, we will export our revolution to the entire world. We will export the Islamic Revolution to the entire world. Now, ask yourself, which country ultimately stands in the way of Iran's maniacal plans to impose radical Islam on the world? And the answer is clear. It's America, the guardian of Western civilization and the world's greatest power. That's why Iran sees America as its greatest enemy. Last month, we had a revealing comment, ostensibly about the war in Gaza, but about something else. It came from the foreign minister of Iran's proxy Hezbah, and he said this. This is not a war with Israel. Israel, he said, is merely a tool The main war, the real war is with America. Iran's regime has been fighting America from the moment it came to power. In 1979, it stormed the American embassy, it held scores of Americans hostage for 444 days. Since then, Iran's terrorist proxies have targeted America in the Middle East and beyond. In Beirut, they killed 241 US servicemen. In Africa, they bombed American embassies. In Iraq, they supplied explosives to maim and kill thousands of American soldiers. In America they actually sent death squads, they sent death squads here to murder a former secretary of state and a former national security advisor. And as we recently learned, they even brazenly threatened to assassinate President Trump. But Iran understands that to truly challenge America, it must first conquer the Middle East and for this, it uses its many proxies, including the Houthis, Hezbollah, and Hamas. Yet in the heart of the Middle East, standing in Iran's way is one proud pro American democracy, my country, the state of Israel.[APPLAUSE] That's why the mobs in Tehran chant death to Israel before they chant death to America. For Iran, Israel is first, America is next. So when Israel fights Hamas, we're fighting Iran. When we fight Hezbollah, we're fighting Iran. When we fight the Houthis, we're fighting Iran and when we fight Iran, we're fighting the most radical and murderous enemy of the United States of America. And one more thing, when Israel acts to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons that could destroy Israel and threaten every American city, every city that you come from. We're not only protecting ourselves, we're protecting you. [APPLAUSE] My friends, if you remember one thing from the speech, remember this. Our enemies are your enemies, our fight is your fight, and our victory will be your victory.[APPLAUSE] Ladies and gentlemen, that victory is in sight. Israel's defeat of Hamas will be a powerful blow to Iran's axis of terror. Another part of that axis Hezbollah attacked Israel on October 8, a day after the Hamas attack. It has launched thousands of missiles and drones against us, 80,000 of our citizens in Northern Israel evacuated their homes, becoming effectively refugees in their own land. We are committed to returning them home. We prefer to achieve this diplomatically. But let me be clear, Israel will do whatever it must do to restore security to our Northern border and return our people safely to their homes. [APPLAUSE] Last Friday, a third Iranian proxy, the Houthis attacked Tel Aviv with a deadly drone, it exploded a few hundred feet from the American Consulate, killing one person and injuring nine. On Saturday, I authorized a swift response to that attack. All our enemies should know this, those who attack Israel will pay a very heavy price [APPLAUSE] and as we defend ourselves on all fronts, I know that America has our back and I thank you for it. All sides of the aisle. Thank you. [APPLAUSE] My friends, for decades, America has provided Israel with generous military assistance and a grateful Israel has provided America with critical intelligence that saved many lives. We've jointly developed some of the most sophisticated weapons on Earth. I choose my words carefully, we've jointly developed some of the most sophisticated weapons on Earth that help protect both our countries and we also help keep Americans boots off the ground while protecting our shared interests in the Middle East. [APPLAUSE] I deeply appreciate America's support, including in this current war. But this is an exceptional moment. Fast tracking US military aid can dramatically expedite an end to the war in Gaza and help prevent a broader war in the Middle East. In World War two, as Britain fought on the front lines of civilization, Winston Churchill appealed to Americans with these famous words, give us the tools and we'll finish the job. Today, as Israel fights on the front line of civilization, I to appeal to America, give us the tools faster and we'll finish the job faster. [APPLAUSE] My dear friends, the war in Gaza could end tomorrow if Hamas surrenders, disarms, and returns all the hostages. [APPLAUSE] But if they don't, Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas' military capabilities, end its rule in Gaza and bring all our hostages home. [APPLAUSE] That's what total victory means, and we will settle for nothing less. The day after we defeat Hamas, a new Gaza can emerge, my vision for that day is of a de militarized and de radicalized Gaza. Israel does not seek to resettle Gaza, but for the foreseeable future, we must retain overriding security control there to prevent the resurgence of terror to ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel. [APPLAUSE] Gaza should have a civilian administration run by Palestinians who do not seek to destroy Israel, that's not too much to ask. It's a fundamental thing that we have a right to demand and to receive. [APPLAUSE] A new generation of Palestinians must no longer be taught to hate Jews, but rather to live in peace with us. [APPLAUSE] Those twin words, de militarization and deradicalization. Those two concepts were applied to Germany and Japan after World War two, and that led to decades of peace, prosperity and security. Following our victory with the help of regional partners, the demilitarization and deradicalization of Gaza can also lead to a future of security, prosperity, and peace. That's my vision for Gaza. [APPLAUSE] Now, here's my vision for the broader Middle East. It's also shaped in part by what we saw in the aftermath of World War II. After that war, America forges security alliance in Europe to counter the growing Soviet threats. Likewise, America and Israel today can forge a security alliance in the Middle East to counter the growing Iranian threat. All countries that are at peace with Israel and all those countries who will make peace with Israel should be invited to join this alliance. We saw a glimpse of that potential alliance on April 14th. Led by the United States, more than half a dozen nations worked alongside Israel to help neutralize hundreds of missiles and drones launched by Iran against us. Thank you, President Biden, for bringing that coalition together. The new alliance I envision would be a natural extension of the ground breaking Abraham Accords. Those accords saw peace forged between Israel and four Arab countries, and they were supported by Republicans and Democrats alike. I have a name for this new alliance. I think we should call it the Abraham Alliance. I want to thank President Trump for his leadership in brokering the stark Abraham Accords. Like Americans, Israelis were relieved that President Trump emerged safe and sound from that dastardly attack on him, dastardly attack on American democracy. There is no room for political violence in democracies. I also want to thank President Trump for all the things he did for Israel, from recognizing Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, to confronting Iran's aggression, to recognizing Jerusalem as our capital, and moving the American embassy there. That's Jerusalem, our eternal capital never to be divided again. My dear friends, Democrats and Republicans, despite these times of upheaval, I'm hopeful about the future. I'm hopeful about Israel because my people, the Jewish people, emerged from the depths of hell, from dispossession and genocide. And against all odds, we restored our sovereignty and our ancient homeland. We built a powerful and vibrant democracy, a democracy that pushes the boundaries of innovation for the betterment of all humanity. I'm hopeful about America, because I'm hopeful about Americans. I know how much the people of this country have sacrificed to defend freedom. America will be continued to be a force for light and good in a dark and dangerous world. For free peoples everywhere, America remains the beacon of liberty, its extraordinary founders envisioned back in 1776. Working together, I'm confident that our two nations will vanquish the tyrants and terrorists who threaten us both. As Israel's Prime Minister, I promise you this, no matter how long it takes, no matter how difficult the road ahead, Israel will not relent. Israel will not bend. We will defend our land. We will defend our people. We will fight until we achieve victory over liberty, rather victory of liberty over tyrany, victory of life over death, victory of good over evil. That's our solemn commitment. And we will continue to work with the United States and our Arab partners to transform a troubled region from a backwater of repression, poverty, and war, into a thriving oasis of dignity, prosperity, and peace. In this noble mission, as in many others, Israel will always remain America's indispensable ally, through thick and thin, in good times and in bad, Israel will always be your loyal friend and your steadfast partner. On behalf of the people of Israel, I came here today to say, thank you, America. Thank you for your support and solidarity. Thank you for standing in Israel with Israel in our hour of need. Together, we shall defend our common civilization. Together, we shall secure a brilliant future for both our nations. May God bless Israel. May God bless America. And may God bless the great alliance between Israel and America forever.

"NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 28, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces it has filed a lawsuit against UiPath, Inc. (""UiPath"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE:PATH) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your UiPath investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.Investors have until August 19, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the ""Class Period""). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was ""executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,"" asserted that ""our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,"" and that ""there's no doubt there's [been] better execution"" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused ""confusion"" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate ""execution strategy to scale"" the Company's AI-powered growth products ""to reach their full potential,"" and that AI had ""create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers."" Ui Path also described how the ""investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs"" while experiencing ""contract execution challenges on large deals.""This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was ""executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,"" asserted that ""our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,"" and that ""there's no doubt there's [been] better execution"" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused ""confusion"" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate ""execution strategy to scale"" the Company's AI-powered growth products ""to reach their full potential,"" and that AI had ""create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers."" Ui Path also described how the ""investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs"" while experiencing ""contract execution challenges on large deals.""This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the ""Class Period""). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was ""executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,"" asserted that ""our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,"" and that ""there's no doubt there's [been] better execution"" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused ""confusion"" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate ""execution strategy to scale"" the Company's AI-powered growth products ""to reach their full potential,"" and that AI had ""create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers."" Ui Path also described how the ""investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs"" while experiencing ""contract execution challenges on large deals.""This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

"NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 22, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces an investigation into Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL) and its directors and certain senior executives for breaches of their fiduciary duties by failing to stop, and/or condoning, pervasive fraud and sexual harassment at the Company.If you are a long-term holder of Globe Life, you are encouraged to submit your information at: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.Investigation Details:A recent investor report has exposed troubling allegations that Globe Life is engaged in widespread insurance fraud. The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (""DOJ"").BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties. BFA intends to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of Globe Life stockholders and to ensure that the fiduciaries are held accountable for the Company's pervasive violations of the law.Click here if you are a long-term holder:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.What Can You Do?If you are a current holder of Globe Life Inc. stock, you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

"NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 22, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces a lawsuit has been filed against MongoDB, Inc.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

"NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 19, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces an investigation into Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL) and its directors and certain senior executives for breaches of their fiduciary duties by failing to stop, and/or condoning, pervasive fraud and sexual harassment at the Company.If you are a long-term holder of Globe Life, you are encouraged to submit your information at: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.Investigation Details:A recent investor report has exposed troubling allegations that Globe Life is engaged in widespread insurance fraud. The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (""DOJ"").BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties. BFA intends to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of Globe Life stockholders and to ensure that the fiduciaries are held accountable for the Company's pervasive violations of the law.Click here if you are a long-term holder:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.What Can You Do?If you are a current holder of Globe Life Inc. stock, you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

"NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 18, 2024 / Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP (""BFA"") announces that it has filed a class action lawsuit for violations of the federal securities laws against CAE Inc. (""CAE"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE:CAE) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered a loss on your CAE investment, please submit your information at https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/cae-inc-investigation.The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in CAE who purchased or acquired CAE stock on an exchange in the United States between February 11, 2022 and May 21, 2024 inclusive (the ""Class Period""). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Norbert Gamache v. CAE Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05360. A copy of the lawsuit can be found here: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/CAEComplaint.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning significant cost overruns in CAE's Defense and Security (""Defense"") segment caused by several fixed-price, long-term Defense contracts entered prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and ""re-baselin[e]"" its entire Defense business.On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts. On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $4.32 per share, or more than 16%, from $25.80 per share on August 9, 2022, to $21.48 per share on August 10, 2022.Defendants, however, continued to make false representations regarding the strength of the Defense segment. For instance, the Company assured investors that ""[n]otwithstanding the additional volatility"" from ""acute short-term headwinds for the Defense sector, management maintains a highly positive view of its growth potential over a multi-year period.""On November 14, 2023, CAE stated that certain legacy contracts continued to be plagued by cost overruns. CAE revealed that, within the Defense segment, the Company planned to ""retir[e] legacy contracts, which have been most affected by inflationary pressures."" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $0.85 per share, or nearly 4%, from $21.92 per share on November 13, 2023, to $21.07 per share on November 14, 2023.Three months later, on February 14, 2024, CAE announced that it ""sought to further accelerate the retirement of outstanding program risks, mainly associated with certain legacy Defense contracts that we entered into pre-COVID and have been most impacted by economic headwinds."" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $2.01 per share, or nearly 10%, from $20.92 per share on February 13, 2024, to $18.91 per share on February 14, 2024.Finally, after the close of trading on May 21, 2024, CAE announced a ""re-baselining of its Defense business, Defense impairments, [and] accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts."" The Company stated that ""CAE has recorded a $568.0 million non-cash impairment of Defense goodwill,"" ""$90.3 million in unfavorable Defense contract profit adjustments as a result of accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts,"" and a ""$35.7 million impairment of related technology and other non-financial assets which are principally related to the Legacy Contracts."" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $1.03 per share, or more than 5%, from $19.83 per share on May 21, 2024, to $18.80 per share on May 22, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/cae-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in CAE, Inc. you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

"NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 18, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces it has filed a lawsuit against UiPath, Inc.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the ""Class Period""). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was ""executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,"" asserted that ""our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,"" and that ""there's no doubt there's [been] better execution"" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused ""confusion"" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million.

"NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 17, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces it has filed a lawsuit against UiPath, Inc.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the ""Class Period""). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was ""executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,"" asserted that ""our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,"" and that ""there's no doubt there's [been] better execution"" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused ""confusion"" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate ""execution strategy to scale"" the Company's AI-powered growth products ""to reach their full potential,"" and that AI had ""create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers."" Ui Path also described how the ""investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs"" while experiencing ""contract execution challenges on large deals.""This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

"NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 17, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces a lawsuit has been filed against MongoDB, Inc. (Nasdaq:MDB) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your MongoDB investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.Investors have until September 9, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Norbert Gamache v. CAE Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05360. A copy of the lawsuit can be found here: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/CAEComplaint.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning significant cost overruns in CAE's Defense and Security (""Defense"") segment caused by several fixed-price, long-term Defense contracts entered prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and ""re-baselin[e]"" its entire Defense business.On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts.

For instance, the Company assured investors that ""[n]otwithstanding the additional volatility"" from ""acute short-term headwinds for the Defense sector, management maintains a highly positive view of its growth potential over a multi-year period.""On November 14, 2023, CAE stated that certain legacy contracts continued to be plagued by cost overruns.

On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $2.01 per share, or nearly 10%, from $20.92 per share on February 13, 2024, to $18.91 per share on February 14, 2024.Finally, after the close of trading on May 21, 2024, CAE announced a ""re-baselining of its Defense business, Defense impairments, [and] accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts."" The Company stated that ""CAE has recorded a $568.0 million non-cash impairment of Defense goodwill,"" ""$90.3 million in unfavorable Defense contract profit adjustments as a result of accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts,"" and a ""$35.7 million impairment of related technology and other non-financial assets which are principally related to the Legacy Contracts.""

"NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 17, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces an investigation into Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL) and its directors and certain senior executives for breaches of their fiduciary duties by failing to stop, and/or condoning, pervasive fraud and sexual harassment at the Company.If you are a long-term holder of Globe Life, you are encouraged to submit your information at: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.Investigation Details:A recent investor report has exposed troubling allegations that Globe Life is engaged in widespread insurance fraud. The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (""DOJ"").BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties. BFA intends to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of Globe Life stockholders and to ensure that the fiduciaries are held accountable for the Company's pervasive violations of the law.Click here if you are a long-term holder:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.What Can You Do?If you are a current holder of Globe Life Inc. stock, you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

"NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 16, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces an investigation into Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL) and its directors and certain senior executives for breaches of their fiduciary duties by failing to stop, and/or condoning, pervasive fraud and sexual harassment at the Company.If you are a long-term holder of Globe Life, you are encouraged to submit your information at: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.Investigation Details:A recent investor report has exposed troubling allegations that Globe Life is engaged in widespread insurance fraud. The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (""DOJ"").BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties. BFA intends to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of Globe Life stockholders and to ensure that the fiduciaries are held accountable for the Company's pervasive violations of the law.Click here if you are a long-term holder:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.What Can You Do?If you are a current holder of Globe Life Inc. stock, you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

A copy of the lawsuit can be found here.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was ""executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,"" asserted that ""our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,"" and that ""there's no doubt there's [been] better execution"" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused ""confusion"" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate ""execution strategy to scale"" the Company's AI-powered growth products ""to reach their full potential,"" and that AI had ""create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers."" Ui Path also described how the ""investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs"" while experiencing ""contract execution challenges on large deals.""This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702.If you suffered losses on your UiPath investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was ""executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,"" asserted that ""our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,"" and that ""there's no doubt there's [been] better execution"" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused ""confusion"" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate ""execution strategy to scale"" the Company's AI-powered growth products ""to reach their full potential,"" and that AI had ""create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers."" Ui Path also described how the ""investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs"" while experiencing ""contract execution challenges on large deals.""This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.A copy of the lawsuit can be found here.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

"NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / June 26, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces it has filed a lawsuit against UiPath, Inc. (""UiPath"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE:PATH) and certain of the Company's senior executives.Investors have until August 19, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the ""Class Period""). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702.If you suffered losses on your UiPath investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was ""executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,"" asserted that ""our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,"" and that ""there's no doubt there's [been] better execution"" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused ""confusion"" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate ""execution strategy to scale"" the Company's AI-powered growth products ""to reach their full potential,"" and that AI had ""create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers."" Ui Path also described how the ""investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs"" while experiencing ""contract execution challenges on large deals.""This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

Description: A global rout in tech stocks sent European markets down across the board, while quarterly results from Stellantis, Renault and Kering also disappointed. On Friday's calendar are Mercedes-Benz, BASF and NatWest.

Video Transcript:
European shares tumble amid a global tech stock rout. Welcome to your Europe Markets Briefing. I am Elena Casas. The STOXX 600 is set for its worst day in over three months. The tech sector sank after a sell-off in US mega caps triggered by poor results from Tesla. Big European names also reported disappointing numbers. Stellantis and Renault both lost over 8% on the back of weak quarterly results, while luxury goods giant Kering fell 7.6% after a bigger-than-expected drop in second-quarter sales. Companies in the Eurozone's two biggest economies are growing more pessimistic, business surveys showed today. In Germany, the Ifo Business Climate Index fell for a fourth straight month. While in France, manufacturers said demand from abroad was weakening and morale in the services sector hit its worst level in more than three years. As President Macron welcomes business leaders to Paris ahead of tomorrow's Olympics, travel firms and airlines have been complaining that tourists are staying away. One strategist told us earlier that the latest economic projections for the Eurozone could turn out to be too optimistic.
Question marks about global growth will prove to be problematic for the Eurozone. So, we have seen those forward-looking survey indicators retreating quite significantly. Expectations within the Ifo survey dipped below the current reading, and that is a rather negative backdrop. So, I think that does suggest that the Euro macroeconomic projections are going to be challenged.
Well, after a fall in Lloyds' profits got UK bank earnings off to a weak start this morning, NatWest is up on Friday. The Conservative government was planning a major public share sale to reduce its 21% stake, but Labour has yet to announce its own plans. Stated pre-tax profits is expected to have dropped to GBP5.1 billion, down by nearly a sixth as interest income falls. Also, up tomorrow is Mercedes-Benz, after weak numbers from Stellantis, Ford, and Nissan today raised fears of a wider slowdown across the car industry. Also reporting are chemicals giant BASF and cement manufacturer Holcim. And flights were halted at Frankfurt Airport this morning after six climate change activists blocked runways by gluing themselves to the tarmac. The protestors were part of a Europe-wide wave of action that also disrupted airports in Switzerland and Norway this morning. While seven Just Stop Oil members were arrested at Heathrow. And that is your Europe Markets Briefing.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

California-based businesses can now get the Ford Pro™ Smart Charging Bundle, a new initiative to help make it easier for businesses to add electric vehicles to their fleet


The bundle offers a complimentary Ford Pro Level 2 EV charger to businesses subscribed to Ford Pro Charging software and gives them advanced energy management features to automate demand response to grid events, reporting, and manage Low Carbon Fuel Standard carbon credits for customers


Ford Pro™, Ford Motor Company’s commercial division, introduces the Ford Pro Smart Charging Bundle to California, one of America’s larger commercial fleet markets.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240717663208/en/(Photo: Business Wire)
Charging operations for electric vehicle fleets can be complex. The Ford Pro Smart Charging Bundle aims to help California businesses with electric vehicles in their fleet while improving operations and reducing upfront and ongoing EV charging costs. The bundle offers a complimentary Ford Pro Level 2 48-amp charger or a Level 2 80-amp charger for depot and workplace charging to businesses subscribed to Ford Pro Charging software.


Going electric for businesses isn’t just about lowering environmental impacts, it’s about the bottom line. The all-electric E-Transit™ requires no gasoline, scheduled maintenance is estimated to be 48 percent less than a gas-powered 2024 Transit®1, and businesses can use the smart charging software to schedule charging during off-peak hours when utility costs are typically lower.


The new automated demand-to-grid response solution in Ford Pro’s Charging Software reacts to grid events in California such as high local demand by automatically pausing charging, alerting the customer, and resuming charging when the event is over. This can help reduce the burden on the grid and reduce the risk of brownouts and blackouts for a more resilient power system. Ford Pro will manage the enrollment process for customers in California grid demand response programs that manage grid capacity, energy programs, and emergency load programs as well as the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) carbon credits program.


“California is an EV pioneer, and new regulations aim to accelerate businesses’ electric transition,” said Ted Cannis, Ford Pro CEO. “We’re here to do the heavy lifting and help companies navigate the complexities of electrification, helping them be more productive and efficient as they add EVs to their fleet. Our smart charging software helps businesses effectively manage their charging operations, including scheduled charging to avoid peak periods when electricity is in high demand at high rates and automated participation in grid events.”

"Volvo Car AB (publ)Following the release of Polestar’s preliminary unaudited financial and operational results for 2023 today Volvo Cars announces that the company estimates that the total net effect on Volvo Cars’ financial results will be non-material. The total net effect is a result of the combination of Polestar’s 2023 results and the change in our ownership percentage in Polestar. The announcement from Polestar today included impairment charges of approximately 450 MUSD in total. Due to the timing of Polestar’s FY 2023 Report the impairment charges were not known to Volvo Cars at the time when Volvo Cars 2023 full year result was reported. Volvo Cars will include an adjustment in its second quarter results 2024 that will be based on Volvo Cars ownership of 48.3 % as of year-end 2023. It will, however, be largely offset by positive effects in the second quarter 2024 from the distribution of Polestar shares and decreased ownership to 18%, which was completed on 8 May 2024. The positive effects mainly relate to release of previously eliminated internal profits based on the change of ownership share.The adjustments for Volvo Cars do not include any effects from Polestar’s undisclosed first half year operational results.The total net effect from the Polestar 2023 driven adjustments and the change of ownership, is estimated to be non-material for Volvo Cars. This will be accounted for as part of the result from JVs and associates in the second quarter 2024, which will be released on July 18, 2024.

Jonas Engström, Head of Operations at Polestar, says: “This is an important step in Polestar’s goal to reach climate neutrality by 2040. Becoming truly climate neutral means eliminating all greenhouse gas emissions across our operations, and all phases of our cars’ life cycles, including emissions from the supply chain. As we enter an accelerating phase of growth with our model line-up and manufacturing footprint expanding, there is an extra emphasis on the need for sustainable logistics solutions.”


Polestar recently published its Sustainability Report for 2023. Greenhouse gas emissions per sold car were reduced by 9% during 2023 compared to 2022, illustrating that it is possible to decouple growth from increased emissions.

"Volvo Car AB (publ)Following the release of Polestar’s preliminary unaudited financial and operational results for 2023 today Volvo Cars announces that the company estimates that the total net effect on Volvo Cars’ financial results will be non-material. The total net effect is a result of the combination of Polestar’s 2023 results and the change in our ownership percentage in Polestar. The announcement from Polestar today included impairment charges of approximately 450 MUSD in total. Due to the timing of Polestar’s FY 2023 Report the impairment charges were not known to Volvo Cars at the time when Volvo Cars 2023 full year result was reported. Volvo Cars will include an adjustment in its second quarter results 2024 that will be based on Volvo Cars ownership of 48.3 % as of year-end 2023. It will, however, be largely offset by positive effects in the second quarter 2024 from the distribution of Polestar shares and decreased ownership to 18%, which was completed on 8 May 2024. The positive effects mainly relate to release of previously eliminated internal profits based on the change of ownership share.The adjustments for Volvo Cars do not include any effects from Polestar’s undisclosed first half year operational results.The total net effect from the Polestar 2023 driven adjustments and the change of ownership, is estimated to be non-material for Volvo Cars. This will be accounted for as part of the result from JVs and associates in the second quarter 2024, which will be released on July 18, 2024.

"Polestar Reduces Supply Chain Emissions Through Integration of Renewable Fuels for Ocean Freight
Polestar (Nasdaq: PSNY) is taking the next steps in reducing its supply chain emissions by integrating renewable fuels on its ocean freight routes, which account for around 75% of Polestar’s total transportation emissions.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240605217610/en/(Photo: Business Wire)
Polestar is now also operating its Vehicle Processing Center (VPC) in Belgium on 100% renewable electricity. The VPC acts as a finishing and preparation point for vehicles before delivery to European customers, including charging them with renewable electricity.


With Polestar 3 and Polestar 4 production now ramping up,renewable fuel will initially be used for approximately 65% of the outbound ocean freight of produced vehicles from Asia to Polestar’s VPC in Zeebrugge, Belgium. Polestar also plans to integrate renewable fuels on freight from North America during the second half of the year, as production of Polestar 3 expands to South Carolina. Through the utilization of B30 Biofuel, which contains 30% Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAME), emissions from these shipping routes can be reduced by approximately 20-25%, compared with conventional Sulphur fuel oils.


Polestar has taken steps to decarbonize inter-continental inbound ocean freight for production materials and spare parts distribution, which are now running on 100% FAME fuel, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 84% compared to fossil fuel. The FAME fuel is based on renewable sources, including waste cooking oil. No feedstock related to palm oil or palm oil production is used.

"BELGRADE, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Vehicle corporation Stellantis commenced test production of a new electric model at a ceremony in Serbia on Monday, according to the government press release.The new electric model is Fiat Grande Panda, unveiled in Turin during Fiat's 125th anniversary celebrations earlier in July. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic took a ride in the new model upon arriving at Fiat's Kragujevac plant, where the ceremony was held, and had a meeting with Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares.Fiat entered a joint venture with the Serbian government in 2008, producing the 500L model, but a decade later, production at the Kragujevac plant was halted by employees' strikes and planned stoppages to adjust supply to demand. In 2022, management announced a two-year closure for major refurbishment.In line with an agreement signed with the Serbian government in May 2022, Stellantis has invested 190 million euros (206.84 million U.S. dollars) in upgrading production facilities over the past two years, with 48 million euros in subsidies from Serbian government.Last Friday, Serbia and the EU signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on sustainable raw materials, battery production chains, and electric vehicles, securing Serbia's rich lithium deposits for the implementation of the EU's green agenda. The deal is expected to attract more investments into Serbia's emerging EV industry.

Video Transcript:
Stellantis may stop making cars in Britain unless the government does more to boost demand for electric vehicles. Welcome to your Europe Markets Briefing. I'm Thomas Warner. Stellantis âs chief executive says that new regulations may force the carmaker to stop its UK production. At least 22% of the new cars each manufacturer sells in the UK this year must be fully electric. Carmakers who fail to meet the target face heavy fines. But industry data suggests that fully electric cars are only made up 16.1% of sales through to May. Maria Grazia Devino told an audience in London today that the carmaker will decide within one year whether to continue manufacturing in the UK or not. Lufthansa will introduce what it calls an environmental cost surcharge from 2025. The German flag carrier said that the charge reflects the cost of sustainable aviation fuel mandates. Fares will go up between EUR1 and EUR72, depending on the ticket. Lufthansa shares fell around 1% on the news. It was one of many European stocks to have a tough day on Tuesday. The German DAX and Frances CAC 40 came under heavy pressure. Major slumps from healthcare giant Merck, as well as Airbus more than offset gains from some energy majors. Those energy gains meant the wider STOXX 600 and London's FTSE fell less heavily. Germany 's Merck recovered some of this morning 's losses but was still down in the high single digits. The diversified healthcare group revealed late on Monday that it's halting the trial of a new cancer treatment. It's the latest in a string of high-profile development setbacks. Airbus shares, meanwhile, trended lower and lower as the day wore on. Investors reacted badly to a cut in its aircraft delivery forecast and therefore its profit. The company blamed supply chain issues. One analyst that we spoke to said that Airbus has missed a golden opportunity.
I think the other thing that's a bit disappointing with all this is the fact if we think about where Boeing is right now and how itâs under a lot of regulatory scrutiny and paring back production, it would have been a good opportunity really for Airbus to potentially pick up some new business. And you know, given the supply chain issues that's looking rather unlikely.
Germany 's 10-year yield dropped slightly, reaching 10-day lows of around 2.39%. Traders await the French election at the weekend and economic data before then. On Wednesday, we'll get fresh insight into how French and German consumers are faring. GfK consumer sentiment data is expected to reveal a 2-point rise to -18.9 for July. That would be the highest reading since April of 2022. French consumer confidence shortly afterwards is seen static, and there'll be French unemployment data for May. It hit its joint lowest since 2011 back in April. AO World will be the first of two rival appliance retailers to report when it publishes its full years on Wednesday. Currys will follow suit the day after. Investors will use the results as a bellwether for UK consumer sentiment. And that is your Europe Markets Briefing.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

"Vauxhall's owner has warned it may stop production in the UK unless the Government encourages more people to switch to electric motoring.Stellantis UK managing director Maria Grazia Davino told an industry conference that a decision on the future of its factories in Ellesmere Port , Cheshire , and Luton , Bedfordshire , could come in ""less than a year"".Under the zero emission vehicle (Zev) mandate, at least 22% of new cars and 10% of new vans sold by each manufacturer in the UK this year are required to be zero emission, which in most cases means pure electric.The threshold will rise annually.Stellantis production in the UK could stopMaria Grazia Davino, StellantisUnder the rules of the mandate, manufacturers risk being required to pay the Government £15,000 per polluting vehicle sold above the limits.But ministers do not expect any businesses to face fines this year, as they will be able to use flexibilities such as purchasing credits from rival companies.Speaking at an event hosted by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders in central London, Ms Grazia Davino reportedly said: ""In the UK there will be consequences (from the policy) for sure. Stellantis UK does not stop, but Stellantis production in the UK could stop.""She added that the next government must ""respond"" to the need to increase demand for electric vehicles, adding: ""I want to keep the production (in the) UK.""Stellantis started electric-only van production at its Ellesmere Port factory in September 2023, and intends to transition its Luton plant to build electric vans from the first half of next year.Labour has pledged to reinstate the 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars if it wins the General Election.Copyright © 2024 independent.co.uk",2024-06-25,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240625:nNRAt2kax7:1,Stellantis,esg
"Stellantis is recalling nearly 1.2 million vehicles in the United States and Canada because of a software glitch that can disable rearview cameras.The recall covers certain vehicles from model years 2022 and 2023 Jeep Compass, Grand Cherokee, Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneers, as well as 2021 through 2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee L SUVs. It also covers 2022 and 2023 Ram ProMaster vans and 2022 Ram 3500 chassis cabs, 1500 pickups and 2500 pickups. Chrysler Pacifica minivans from 2021 through 2023 and Dodge Durango SUVs from 2021 and 2022 are also included in the recall.A company investigation determined that radio software in some vehicles could inadvertently disable their rearview cameras, Stellantis spokesperson Frank Matyok said. The company is not aware of any injuries or accidents related to the glitch, but urged customers to follow recall instructions. The recall spans 1.033 million vehicles in the United States and 126,000 in Canada.The company plans to fix the issue with a software update. More than 735,000 affected vehicles have received the update so far, Matyok said. Owners of an additional 298,000 vehicles are advised to accept a request for the update on their media screens. The company will also send recall notices by mail beginning Aug. 2, according to documents published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.Drivers can confirm if their specific vehicle is included in this recall using the NHTSA site.Stellantis's radio software glitch comes after the company had to recall more than 200,000 SUVs and pickup trucks last week due to a separate software malfunction that could cause a vehicle's stability control to fail, which increases the risk of a crash.Other automakers have issued recalls related to rearview and backup cameras over the past several months. In May, Honda recalled nearly 200,000 pickup trucks over concerns that rearview cameras could stop working in cold weather. Tesla also recalled about 200,000 vehicles in January after some backup cameras malfunctioned while in reverse. Ford Motor and Range Rover have also recalled vehicles with faulty backup cameras in the last year.Copyright (c) 2024 The Washington Post",2024-06-18,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240618:nNRAt07b4w:1,Stellantis,esg

"Jun 11, 2024StellantisSTLA is recalling 211,581 pickup trucks and SUVs due to a defect in software that could disable their electronic stability control (ESC) systems.The problem originates from a defective anti-lock braking system (ABS), which deactivates the ESC, a critical safety feature preventing loss of steering in emergencies, such as on icy or flooded roads.Per the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (""NHTSA""), using a vehicle with a disabled ESC increases the risk of crashes. Studies show that ESC systems significantly reduce fatal collisions, especially single-vehicle and rollover crashes.Since 2012, the NHTSA has required all new passenger cars to include ESC.The recall affects the 2022 Dodge Durango, and 2022 Ram 2500 and 3500. Nearly 158,000 Ram 2500 pickups, more than 53,000 Durangos and 524 Ram 3500s are involved.

By creating simulation models, the time and cost needed to bring new battery technologies to the market is greatly reduced.

The query was posed in light of the EV transition happening ""slightly slower than many people expected"". This year Stellantis has 25 product launches planned, with 18 of those carrying EV options. ""The majority of our products are either ICE vehicles or intended to utilise [the] multi-energy platforms we have,"" Ms Knight said. She emphasised that those launches were not focused on ""just expanding"" BEV-only products into other offerings.Afeela new model coming onIn-vehicle karaoke, TV streaming and customisable e-motor noises were all notable features of Sony Honda Mobility's (SHM) Afeela prototype when Just Auto was recently given an online demonstration from Los Angeles. First unveiled in January this year, the prototype is the result of a 50:50 JV between Japanese industry giants Honda and Sony. Pre-orders were confirmed by SMH CEO Yasuhide Mizuno to take place in H1 2025, with sales to follow by the end of 2025 and deliveries to US customers scheduled for early 2026. Quizzed during the demonstration on how the brand felt about entering an already-crowded EV market, an Afeela spokesperson said: ""We don't want to say we're competing - we're providing a new option.""US growth endsApril brought an end to a 20 month YoY growth streak in the US vehicle market, according to GlobalData. According to preliminary estimates, Light Vehicle (LV) sales in the US declined by 3.9% YoY in April, to 1.32 million units. The 20-month YoY growth streak came to an end, but that was unsurprising given that April 2023 had an additional selling day. Furthermore, the pace of sales picked up significantly a year ago, making YoY growth much more difficult to achieve. US LV sales totaled 1.32 million units in April, according to GlobalData. The annualized selling rate was 15.7 million units/year in April, up from 15.6 million units/year in March. The daily selling rate was estimated at 52,700 units/day in April, compared to 53,700 units/day in March. It is noteworthy that the April daily selling rate was almost identical to the rate a year earlier; the YoY fall was therefore attributable to the loss of a selling day. The market continues to display very mixed results, with some OEMs performing well, while others are struggling. According to initial estimates, retail sales totaled 1.09 million units in April, while fleet sales finished at approximately 229k units, representing around just 17.4% of total sales.China's flatA GlobalData report showed China light vehicle wholesales reached 2.1 million units in March. The automobile market experienced flat growth in the first quarter of 2024, with intensifying competition. In March, domestic sales of Light Vehicles (LV), excluding exports, reached 2.1 million units, reflecting a 4.6% year-on-year (YoY) increase. Specifically, Passenger Vehicle (PV) sales in March saw a YoY increase of 5.4% to 1.9 million units, while Light Commercial Vehicle (LCV) sales reached 288 thousand units, experiencing a slight YoY decrease of 0.2%. This growth can be attributed to post-holiday consumer spending and an intensified price war, resulting in a 79.1% month-on-month (MoM) increase in PV sales and an 87.0% MoM boost in LCV sales.

"We spoke to Gavin White, CEO, and co-founder at About: Energy, to discuss how the simulation technology works and highlight the benefits it provides the automotive industry. Stellantis on ICE&amp; hybrid Answering questions on the possibility of expanding ICE and hybrid options on its STLA platform at its recent Q1 2024 Results and Shipments call, Stellantis CFO... Our weekly review of features and newsBattery testing can be a costly and time consuming process that results in many failed prototypes and wasted materials. What if there were a simpler way to test? Founded with the belief that simulation and modelling can be used to assist and accelerate the development of new battery technology, leading battery data and software company About:Energy, says it is accelerating electrification through battery virtual prototyping. By creating simulation models, the time and cost needed to bring new battery technologies to the market is greatly reduced. Moreover, it can also allow designers and engineers to compare design options in a simple interface ('Voltt'). We spoke to Gavin White, CEO, and co-founder at About:Energy, to discuss how the simulation technology works and highlight the benefits it provides the automotive industry.Stellantis on ICE &amp; hybridAnswering questions on the possibility of expanding ICE and hybrid options on its STLA platform at its recent Q1 2024 Results and Shipments call, Stellantis CFO Natalie Knight said the automaker was ""very open"" on how it could ""best address the consumer need."" The query was posed in light of the EV transition happening ""slightly slower than many people expected"". This year Stellantis has 25 product launches planned, with 18 of those carrying EV options. ""The majority of our products are either ICE vehicles or intended to utilise [the] multi-energy platforms we have,"" Ms Knight said. She emphasised that those launches were not focused on ""just expanding"" BEV-only products into other offerings.Afeela new model coming onIn-vehicle karaoke, TV streaming and customisable e-motor noises were all notable features of Sony Honda Mobility's (SHM) Afeela prototype when Just Auto was recently given an online demonstration from Los Angeles. First unveiled in January this year, the prototype is the result of a 50:50 JV between Japanese industry giants Honda and Sony. Pre-orders were confirmed by SMH CEO Yasuhide Mizuno to take place in H1 2025, with sales to follow by the end of 2025 and deliveries to US customers scheduled for early 2026. Quizzed during the demonstration on how the brand felt about entering an already-crowded EV market, an Afeela spokesperson said: ""We don't want to say we're competing - we're providing a new option.""US growth endsApril brought an end to a 20 month YoY growth streak in the US vehicle market, according to GlobalData. According to preliminary estimates, Light Vehicle (LV) sales in the US declined by 3.9% YoY in April, to 1.32 million units. The 20-month YoY growth streak came to an end, but that was unsurprising given that April 2023 had an additional selling day. Furthermore, the pace of sales picked up significantly a year ago, making YoY growth much more difficult to achieve. US LV sales totaled 1.32 million units in April, according to GlobalData. The annualized selling rate was 15.7 million units/year in April, up from 15.6 million units/year in March. The daily selling rate was estimated at 52,700 units/day in April, compared to 53,700 units/day in March. It is noteworthy that the April daily selling rate was almost identical to the rate a year earlier; the YoY fall was therefore attributable to the loss of a selling day. The market continues to display very mixed results, with some OEMs performing well, while others are struggling. According to initial estimates, retail sales totaled 1.09 million units in April, while fleet sales finished at approximately 229k units, representing around just 17.4% of total sales.China's flatA GlobalData report showed China light vehicle wholesales reached 2.1 million units in March. The automobile market experienced flat growth in the first quarter of 2024, with intensifying competition. In March, domestic sales of Light Vehicles (LV), excluding exports, reached 2.1 million units, reflecting a 4.6% year-on-year (YoY) increase. Specifically, Passenger Vehicle (PV) sales in March saw a YoY increase of 5.4% to 1.9 million units, while Light Commercial Vehicle (LCV) sales reached 288 thousand units, experiencing a slight YoY decrease of 0.2%. This growth can be attributed to post-holiday consumer spending and an intensified price war, resulting in a 79.1% month-on-month (MoM) increase in PV sales and an 87.0% MoM boost in LCV sales.

"PATH DEADLINE ALERT: UiPath, Inc. (NYSE:PATH) Investors are Alerted of an Upcoming Deadline in Securities Fraud Class Action Contact BFA Law if you Suffered LossesUIPATH INC (""PATH-N;9UV-F"")
- PATH DEADLINE ALERT: UiPath, Inc. (NYSE:PATH) Investors are Alerted
- of an Upcoming Deadline in Securities Fraud Class Action - Contact
- BFA Law if you Suffered Losses

     Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces it
has filed a lawsuit against UiPath, Inc. (UiPath or the Company)
(NYSE:PATH) and certain of the Companys senior executives.

     If you suffered losses on your UiPath investment, you are encouraged
to submit your information at
https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.

     Investors have until August 19, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed
to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and
20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in
UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May
29, 2024 inclusive (the Class Period). The case is pending in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack
Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be
found https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.

     What is the Lawsuit About?

     The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants
made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of
UiPaths turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the
Company was executing against that strategy, and were seeing [the] results
in the deal quality and the customer quality, asserted that our strategic
investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well
for continued momentum, and that theres no doubt theres [been] better
execution since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.

     These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In
truth, UiPaths turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and
inconsistent execution plagued the Companys overhauled go-to-market
strategy. Additionally, UiPaths AI-powered Business Automation Platform
caused confusion among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled.
As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or
expanding large multiyear deals.

     On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert
Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial
results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150
million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several
factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate
execution strategy to scale the Companys AI-powered growth products to
reach their full potential, and that AI had create[ed] a little bit of
confusion with our customers. Ui Path also described how the investments we
have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations,
[and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs while experiencing
contract execution challenges on large deals.

     This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share,
or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per
share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.

"Monday, Jul 22July 22 (Renewables Now) - UK renewables developer-operator Harmony Energy on Friday announced plans to build a 100-MW/200-MWh battery in France, set to create the country's largest energy storage system.The Chevire facility will offer two hours of discharge capacity, which will be enough to supply the average needs of 170,000 homes. The project will deploy Tesla Inc's ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) Megapack technology.The battery energy storage system (BESS) will be constructed in Nantes Saint-Nazaire Harbour, on a site that housed the already retired Chevire oil, coal and gas power station. Once in operation, it will provide critical balancing services to the French electricity grid network and enable the further addition of renewable energy to replace fossil fuels.Harmony Energy plans to start building works shortly and bring the BESS online in the winter season of 2025.Set up in 2010, Harmony Energy is currently operating more than 1 GW of batteries in the UK and has a European pipeline exceeding 13 GW. In March , the company energised a 99 MW/198 MWh battery in Essex, England, in partnership with renewables developer-operator Fotowatio Renewable Ventures (FRV).Copyright (c) 2024 SeeNews.

"Not for a review, operational tweaks, or any chats about streamlining efficiency; a staff meeting at Teslas Berlin factory was called last week to discuss a rather pressing matter.At the meetings kick-off, Andre Thierig, plant manager at Teslas Berlin Gigafactory, dropped a bombshell: Ill throw you a number  65,000. While the staffers guessed in vain that this was some production target figure, Andre revealed that this was the staggering count of coffee cups purchased since plant production began.Im just about done approving orders for more coffee cups, he lamented, saying, Thats right, 65,000 mugs! Statistically speaking, with 12,000 of you on board, each has already amassed five Ikea coffee cups at home.Frustrated by rampant theft of mugs, Andre declared, There would be no more cutlery in break rooms until the mug thefts stopped. According to a report in the German newspaper Handelsblatt, Andres light-hearted jibe drew chuckles and applause from the workforce.Tesla's Berlin plant in the spotlightTeslas Gigafactory in Berlin recently found itself in the limelight after employees raised concerns about working conditions, citing long hours and a culture of fear. Workers also pointed to several workplace accidents.IG Metall, the German union representing Teslas Gigafactory workforce, noted that many employees are hesitant to discuss their concerns due to non-disclosure agreements that they signed along with their contracts.Separately, a self-declared anti-capitalist group Disrupt has been calling for the closure of the plant, saying electric cars are neither eco-friendly nor sustainable. A recent viral video showing clashes between Disrupt activists and law enforcement has only intensified the controversy.The production of electric cars leaves a colossal ecological footprint by guzzling resources, exacerbating the global climate quagmire, says Disrupt on its website.Copyright (c) 2024 Business Standard Ltd.",2024-07-17,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240717:nNRAt9vmzr:1,Tesla,esg
"A growing number of investigations and legal complaints are targeting Tesla's claims that its cars are ""Full Self-Driving,"" scrutinizing the company's decisions to brand and market its suite of driver-assistance technologies for evidence of potential fraud.The U.S. Justice Department is probing the company's marketing of both Full Self-Driving and Autopilot, Tesla's advanced driver-assistance systems. California's Department of Motor Vehicles is also reviewing those features in light of provisions, including a 2022 law prohibiting companies from using marketing and language that would ""lead a reasonable person to believe that the feature allows the vehicle to function as an autonomous vehicle."" Tesla has received inquiries from the Securities and Exchange Commission related to its claims to investors, according to news reports and public filings. And a civil lawsuit in California represents drivers who say they were defrauded by the company's claims and are seeking refunds and damages over their purchases.At issue is whether the term Full Self-Driving implies that the cars are autonomous — meaning drivers don't need to pay attention. In recent court filings, Tesla says that the cars are not ""autonomous"" and that its user manuals and sensors alert drivers to the need to hold the wheel and keep their eyes on the road. Yet in a post on X last month, Tesla's head of Autopilot, Ashok Elluswamy, used the word, writing that the cars ""have the most autonomous capability compared to any production car.""Tesla, CEO Elon Musk and Elluswamy did not respond to requests for comment. The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, through spokespeople, declined to comment.The wave of scrutiny comes less than a month before Tesla is due to unveil what it calls a robotaxi, a dedicated vehicle that would run a version of its Full Self-Driving software, shuttling passengers between destinations without a driver. (It has no known production timeline, and Tesla is known for making ambitious product announcements without concrete delivery plans.)Many of the probes and lawsuits weigh similar claims made by Musk.Most Tesla cars today come with a feature it calls Autopilot, a suite of software that allows vehicles to keep their distance behind others, maintain a set speed and steer on highways, following the trajectory of lane lines. The company has for years offered an upgrade package called Full Self-Driving, which costs $8,000 (down from $15,000) — or $99 a month — and enables its vehicles to navigate city and residential streets on their own, provided the driver demonstrates they are paying attention.Tesla promised customers years ago that this upgrade would turn cars into an appreciable asset — meaning their value would increase over time — after they one day become autonomous through a software update. That has yet to happen, and that's what the California lawsuit is about.""Contrary to Tesla's repeated promises that it would have a fully self-driving car within months or a year, Tesla has never been remotely close to achieving that goal,"" reads the civil complaint in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, which is seeking class-action certification. In addition to financial remedies, it asks for an injunction prohibiting Tesla from continuing to market its technology in ""deceptive and misleading"" ways.""One of the arguments we make is you can't get more self-driving than fully self-driving,"" said attorney Andrew Kirtley, who is representing customers in the Autopilot class-action suit.Among the statements under scrutiny, according to interviews and documents: Musk's 2019 pronouncement that Tesla would put 1 million robotaxis on the road by 2020 and Tesla's assertions that its vehicles have all the hardware needed to deploy the Full Self-Driving feature. The Northern California civil lawsuit specifically cites Musk's assertion on a 2016 conference call that a Tesla would be able to drive itself from Los Angeles to New York ""by the end of next year without the need for a single touch.""In that case, drivers allege that they were misled into paying for a feature that still hasn't materialized. Meanwhile, at least two dozen people have died in crashes in which Tesla's driver-assistance features were engaged, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; in some cases, they were alleged to be driving under the influence or distracted.In Tesla's response to the California lawsuit, the company claims its driver-assistance features — including steering, accelerating and merging — make the cars ""self-driving, but not autonomous."" It has made the same claim on its website, saying that Autopilot and Full Self-Driving ""features do not make the vehicle autonomous"" and that its systems are ""intended to be used only with a fully attentive driver.""But legal experts question the distinction: ""When I hear self-driving and autonomous I kind of hear the same thing,"" said Anthony Casey, a University of Chicago law professor, adding that the legal question will revolve around ""what would a normal person hear"" in the term ""self-driving.""Still, he said, the bar for proving that Tesla's marketing claims amount to fraud, particularly criminal fraud, is high. ""You also would have to show that they intended to get [a person] to buy it by misleading you,"" Casey said.Tesla is far from the first company to tussle with regulators and federal officials over the ambitious promises of its tech. Legal experts said other companies in similar situations have made the same argument Tesla is making: that failure to deliver on its promises is not a crime.An attorney for Elizabeth Holmes, the disgraced Silicon Valley wunderkind who promoted a medical device that could purportedly perform a battery tests with a tiny amount of blood, made this argument explicitly during Holmes's 2021 criminal trial. ""Failure is not a crime,"" the attorney argued. ""Trying your hardest and coming up short is not a crime."" A jury disagreed: Holmes was convicted and is serving an 11-year prison sentence.In the ongoing Justice Department probe, investigators have focused on Tesla's promises, according to John Bernal, a former Tesla Autopilot employee who was interviewed by an FBI agent and a representative of the U.S. Transportation Department for five hours in 2022.""They kept saying over and over again their focus is in terms of marketing with the namesake,"" Bernal said, referring to terms such as Autopilot and Full Self-Driving. ""They believe that those namesakes imply a higher sense of functionality than they actually deliver.""Bernal said ""their main holy grail info they were seeking was they wanted physical, written documentation in advertisement or marketing form"" that Tesla was billing its driver-assistance systems as autonomous. Bernal did not have evidence of that, he said. He said the officials told him their investigation had stretched back to 2018 and involved interviews with numerous employees.Federal officials have focused at least in part on a 2016 Tesla marketing video, set to the Rolling Stones song ""Paint It Black,"" that purported to show a Tesla maneuvering near the company's headquarters on its own, which came up repeatedly in the interview with Bernal. ""The person in the driver's seat is only there for legal reasons,"" the 2016 video's opening slide reads. ""He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself.""A Tesla official later acknowledged, after reporting by the New York Times, that the video was staged and the car in fact crashed during filming.At the time, Musk was deep into a push to make Teslas capable of autonomy, an effort that led to heated back-and-forths between him and the engineers responsible for delivering. At one point, Musk left a car during a test drive after the software performed badly, slamming the door shut and walking back toward Tesla's offices.""Nothing f---ing works,"" Musk fumed before storming off, according to a person with knowledge of the episode, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.A recent Musk biography said Musk frequently would show up to Tesla's office dismayed by the software's performance.A few months after the incident newly detailed by The Washington Post, Tesla released the ""Paint It Black"" video.Tesla, in response to another lawsuit, called the video an ""aspirational"" demonstration of its software's potential capabilities.Similar videos have been used in other cases — even against another electric vehicle manufacturer. Trevor Milton, the founder of electric truck start-up Nikola, was found guilty of misleading investors in a federal fraud case that alleged a video demonstration of its truck's capabilities, in reality, showed the truck rolling downhill rather than propelling itself on its own.Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor, said the civil case would be most likely to gain momentum in the short term, given the extended nature of federal investigations and the lower burden of proof in civil cases.""There were some representations, especially video, that they made … look better than it actually was,"" he said. ""And I think people felt manipulated in that context: that they overrated how quickly they could do things or how well it could perform and that kind of thing as a sales technique.""Tobias said customers' reliance on those claims could entitle them to refunds.Musk had been pushing for autonomous capability in his cars for years, in ways that were at times inconsistent with Tesla's level of progress and to the chagrin of safety officials who had not anticipated such a brazen effort to bill consumer vehicles as self-driving, The Post has reported.Around late 2014, software entrepreneur Dan O'Dowd said he'd learned Musk was planning to deliver an autonomous vehicle by the end of the following year. Now a vocal Tesla critic, O'Dowd was at the time a contractor for Tesla whose company helped streamline the Autopilot technology to take up less computer space.In 2019, Musk made another audacious promise: to put 1 million robotaxis on the road by 2020, in part by utilizing the privately owned Teslas sitting in people's driveways. ""The fleet wakes up with an over-the-air update,"" Musk said at the time.That didn't happen. Instead, Tesla has focused on smaller developments, releasing the first iteration of its Full Self-Driving software, known as Full Self-Driving Beta, in late 2020, followed by successive improvements such as better recognition of road signs and lane markings and aiming for smoother driving. Musk launched the latest version of the software, known as V12, this year, touting it as a revolutionary leap forward.In April, Musk made a new promise: ""Tesla Robotaxi unveil on 8/8,"" he wrote. On Thursday, however, Bloomberg News reported that Tesla planned to delay the event to October.Tom Gorman, former senior counsel in the SEC's division of enforcement, said Musk's robotaxi statements could also be reviewed by the agency, which would scrutinize the promises in light of investor decisions. Musk's robotaxi promise was made amid slumping stock prices in the first half of 2024.""If he really doesn't have the ability to do what he's doing … they'd go after him for that,"" Gorman said. ""If you're saying, 'I am going to have a completely self-driving car and it can drive you around the planet completely by yourself two weeks from now,' and you're starting to hype that, he'll probably get sued.""Copyright (c) 2024 The Washington Post",2024-07-16,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240711:nNRAt7xk6e:31,Tesla,esg
"California will have to build public charging stations at an unprecedented — and some experts say unrealistic — pace to meet the needs of the 7 million electric cars expected on its roads in less than seven years.The sheer scale of the buildout has alarmed many experts and lawmakers, who fear that the state won't be prepared as Californians purchase more electric cars.A million public chargers are needed in California by the end of 2030, according to the state's projections — almost 10 times more than the number available to drivers in December. To meet that target, 129,000 new stations — more than seven times the current pace — must be built every year for the next seven years. Then the pace would have to accelerate again to reach a target of 2.1 million chargers in 2035.A robust network of public chargers — akin to the state's more than 8,000 gas stations — is essential to ensure that drivers will have the confidence to purchase electric vehicles over the next several years.""It is very unlikely that we will hit our goals, and to be completely frank, the EV goals are a noble aspiration, but unrealistic,"" said Stanford professor Bruce Cain, who co-authored a policy briefing detailing California's electric vehicle charging problems. ""This is a wakeup call that we address potential institutional and policy obstacles more seriously before we commit blindly.""Under California's landmark electric car mandate , a pillar of Gov. Gavin Newsom's climate change agenda , 68% of all new 2030 model cars sold in the state must be zero emissions, increasing to 100% for 2035, when 15 million electric cars are expected in California.""We're going to look really silly if we are telling people that they can only buy electric vehicles, and we don't have the charging infrastructure to support that,"" said Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, a Democrat from Encino who introduced a package of unsuccessful bills last year aimed at expanding access to car chargers.""We are way behind where we need to be,"" Gabriel told CalMatters.Big obstacles stand in the way of amping up the pace of new charging stations in public places. California will need billions of dollars in state, federal and private investments, streamlined city and county permitting processes, major power grid upgrades and accelerated efforts by utilities to connect chargers to the grid.State officials also are tasked with ensuring that charging stations are available statewide, in rural and less-affluent areas where private companies are reluctant to invest, and that they are reliable and functioning whenever drivers pull up.In Pacific Gas &amp; Electric's vast service area, home to 40% of all Californians, electric car purchases are moving twice as fast as the buildout of charging stations, said Lydia Krefta, the utility's director of clean energy transportation. Californians now own more than 1.5 million battery-powered cars.Patty Monahan, who's on the Energy Commission, the state agency responsible for funding and guiding the ramp-up, told CalMatters that she is confident that California can build the chargers its residents need in time.The agency's estimate of the current chargers is likely an undercount, she said. In addition, fast-charging stations could play a bigger role than initially projected, meaning hundreds of thousands of fewer chargers might be needed. Also, as the ranges and charging speeds on cars improve, there may be less demand for public chargers.""California has a history of defying the odds,"" Monahan said. ""We have a history of advancing clean cars, clean energy, writ-large. We have naysayers left and right saying you can't do it, and then we do it.""Barriers to private investments: an uncertain marketOn a September day last year, Monahan spoke behind a podium in the parking lot of a Bay Area grocery store. A row of newly constructed car chargers rose behind her.""Let's celebrate for a moment,"" she said.California had met its goal of 10,000 fast electric chargers statewide — two years ahead of a target set in 2018.Fast chargers like the new ones at the grocery store are increasingly seen as critical to meeting the needs of drivers. They can power a car to 80% in 20 minutes to an hour, while the typical charger in use today, a slower Level 2, takes from four to 10 hours.But installing and operating fast chargers is an expensive business — one that doesn't easily turn a profit.Nationwide each fast charger can cost up to $117,000, according to a 2023 study. And in California, it could be even more — between $122,000 and $440,000 each, according to a separate study , although the Energy Commission said the range was $110,000 to $125,000 for one of its programs .Most of America's publicly traded charger companies have been forced to seek more financing, lay off workers and slow their network build outs, analysts said. EVgo , for instance, has seen its share price crater, as has ChargePoint , which specializes in selling the slower, Level 2 hardware.California stands apart from other states — it has by far the most chargers and electric car sales, and more incentives and policies encouraging them.Tesla, America's top-selling electric car manufacturer, dominates fast-charging in both California and the U.S. — but the company didn't get into the business to sell charges to drivers; it got into the charger business to sell its electric cars. Initially Tesla Superchargers were exclusive to its drivers, but starting this year other EV drivers can use them after Tesla provided ports to Ford and other automakers.Tesla's manufacturing prowess, supply chain dominance and decade-plus of experience with fast chargers have given it an edge over competitors — a coterie of unprofitable, publicly traded startups, as well as private companies that often benefit from public subsidies, according to analysts.""All the automakers joined forces with their biggest competitor,"" said Loren McDonald, chief executive of the consulting firm EVAdoption. ""If that doesn't tell you how bad fast-charging networks and infrastructure were, I don't know what else does.""Now Tesla is showing uncertainty about the future of its charging business amid slumping car sales, and eliminated nearly its entire 500-member Supercharger team in April. Then chief executive Elon Musk said in May that he would spend $500 million to expand the network and hired back some fired workers.In California, Electrify America, a privately held company, was created by Volkswagen as a settlement for cheating on emissions tests for its gas-powered cars. The company is spending $800 million on California chargers, building a robust network of 260 stations, with more than half in low-income communities, including the state's worst charging desert , Imperial County.The problem is Electrify America was ranked dead last in a consumer survey last year, and its chargers have been plagued by reliability problems and customer complaints. The California Air Resources Board in January directed Electrify America to ""strive to achieve charger reliability consistent with the state of the industry."" A company spokesperson said the dissatisfaction showed ""an industry in its growth trajectory."" There are signs of improvement, based on consumer data from the first three months of this year.Startups continue to jump into the charging business, with the number of companies offering fast chargers growing from 14 in 2020 to 41 in 2024, EVAdoption said. Seven carmakers formed a $1 billion venture to build a 30,000-charger network in North America. And gas stations such as Circle K are offering more charging because electric car customers spend more time shopping while waiting for their rides to juice up.But the realization that charging is a costly business has set in on Wall Street, and that doesn't seem likely to change anytime soon. ""Can public EV fast-charging stations be profitable in the United States?"" the consultancy McKinsey &amp; Company asked .""The fervor, the excitement from the investor base, has definitely dwindled quite a bit, given the prospects that EV adoption in the U.S. is going to be slower, revenue growth is really slower, the path to profitability is going to be slower, and they might need more capital than everyone originally expected,"" said Christopher Dendrinos, a financial analyst who covers electric car charging companies for the investment bank RBC Capital Markets.The stakes are high for California when it comes to encouraging investments in expensive fast chargers: If 63,000 additional ones were built, California might need 402,000 fewer slower Level 2 chargers in 2030, according to an alternative forecast by the Energy Commission.Billions of public dollars: Will it be enough?Nationwide $53 billion to $127 billion in private investments and public funding is needed by 2030 to build chargers for about 33 million electric cars, according to a federal estimate . Of that, about half would be for public chargers.Congress and the Biden administration have set aside $5 billion for a national network of fast chargers. So far only 33 in eight locations have been built, but more than 14,000 others are in the works, according to the Federal Highway Administration. California's share of the federal money totals $384 million; about 500 fast chargers will be built with an initial $40.5 million, said Energy Commission spokesperson Lindsay Buckley.In addition, the state has spent $584 million to build more than 33,000 electric car chargers through its Clean Transportation Program, funded by fees drivers pay when they register cars. The Legislature extended that program for an additional decade last year.Newsom has committed to spending $1 billion through 2028 on chargers with his "" California Climate Commitment ,"" Buckley said. But this year Newsom and the Legislature trimmed $167 million from the charger budget as the state faces a record deficit. A lobbyist for the Electric Vehicle Charging Association said ""the state pullback sends a very challenging message"" to the industry.California's commitment to charger funding is ""solid,"" despite the cuts, Buckley said. They have not yet estimated the total investment needed in California to meet the targets.But Ted Lamm, a UC Berkeley Law researcher who studies electric car infrastructure, said the magnitude of building what California needs in coming years likely dwarfs the public funding available.State and federal programs will ""only fund a fraction,"" and the state needs to spend that money on lower-income communities, he said.Another possible funding source is California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which is expected to be revised in November . The program requires carbon-intensive fuel companies to pay for cleaner-burning transportation. Utilities get credits and use that money to pay for chargers, rebates to car buyers and grid improvements, said Laura Renger, executive director of the California Electric Transportation Coalition, which represents utilities.""I think with that, we would have enough money,"" Renger said. She said the program's overhaul could help utilities invest ""billions"" in chargers and other electric car programs over the next two decades.Backlogged local permits and grid delaysOne of the biggest barriers to more chargers isn't money. It's that cities and counties are slow to approve plans for the vast number of stations needed.State officials only have so much political power to compel local jurisdictions to do what they want — a reality made abundantly clear by the housing crisis , for instance. California relies on grants and persuasion to accomplish its goals, and the slow buildout of chargers shows how those strategies can fall short, said Stanford's Cain.""The locals cannot be compelled by regulatory agencies to make land and resources available for what the state wants to achieve,"" Cain said.The same obstacles have marked the state's broader effort to electrify California and switch to clean energy. Local opposition and environmental reviews sometimes hold up large solar projects and transmission projects for years.California has created a ""culture of regulation that emphasizes the need to be extra careful and extra perfect, but this takes an incredible amount of time,"" Steve Bohlen, senior director of government affairs at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, said last month at the inaugural hearing of the state Assembly's Select Committee on Permitting Reform .""We're moving into a period of rapid change, and so perfect can't be the enemy of the good.""Chargers aren't as complicated as large-scale solar or offshore wind projects . But most chargers installed in public spaces do need a land-use or encroachment permit, among other approvals. California has passed laws requiring local jurisdictions to streamline permits for chargers. What's more, the Governor's Office of Business Development now grades cities and counties using a scorecard and maintains a map displaying who has, or hasn't, made life easier for car charger builders. But these strategies only go so far.""It doesn't matter how many requirements you put on (local governments),"" Lamm said. ""If they just don't have the time in the day to do it ... it's going to sit in the backlog, because that's how it works.""The delays have consequences. Getting a station permitted in California, on average, takes 26% longer than the national average, Electrify America reported. Designing and constructing a station in California can cost on average 37% more than in other states because of delays in permitting and grid connections. A utility on average takes 17 weeks after work is completed to connect chargers to the grid, Electric America said.Powering large charging projects often requires grid upgrades, which can take a year or more for approval, said Chanel Parson, a director at Southern California Edison. Supply chain issues also make getting the right equipment a challenge.Edison, which has a 10-year plan to meet expected demand, has asked the utilities commission for approval to upgrade the grid where it anticipates high charging demand.""Every EV charging infrastructure project is a major construction project,"" Parson said. ""There are a number of variables that influence how long it takes to complete the project.""Impatient with broken chargers, bad serviceInspired to help the nation reduce its dependence on fossil fuels, Zach Schiff-Abrams of Los Angeles bought a Genesis GV60. As a renter, he has relied on public charging, primarily using Electrify America stations — and that's been his biggest problem about owning an electric car.Charging speeds have been inconsistent, he said, with half-hour sessions providing only a 15 to 30% charge, and he often encounters broken chargers.""I believe in electrical, so I'm really actually trying to be a responsible consumer,"" Schiff-Abrams said. ""I want to report them when they're down, but the customer service is horrible.""For years, the reliability of charging networks has been a well-documented problem. Only 73% of fast chargers in the San Francisco Bay Area were functional in a 2022 study. The growth of the EV market has put increasing strain on public charging stations, a consumer survey found .In January , the California Air Resources Board approved a final $200 million spending plan for Electrify America — but not before board chair Liane Randolph scolded its CEO.Randolph — arguably one of America's top climate regulators — told CEO Robert Barrosa about an exchange she had with his company's customer service line after finding a broken charger at a station along Interstate-5.""It didn't work,"" Randolph said during the board meeting. ""Called the customer service line, waited like 10-ish minutes. ...(The charger) was showing operable on the app and the guy goes, 'oh, my data is showing me that it has not had a successful charge in three days.'""""These issues are not easy,"" Barrosa responded. ""Our head is not in the sand,"" he told board members earlier. ""We are listening to customers.""But Randolph, addressing journalists at a conference in Philadelphia , pushed back against the idea that because the transition to electric vehicles is happening gradually that it's a failure. Many people will rely on charging at home or work, and batteries are becoming more efficient.""The infrastructure is continuing to be rolled out at a rapid pace,"" Randolph said. ""It doesn't all have to be perfect instantly. It's a process. And it's a process that's continuing to move.""——-Data journalists Erica Yee and Arfa Momin contributed to this report.___This story was originally published by CalMatters and distributed through a partnership with The Associated Press.",2024-07-16,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240716:nNRAt9lqml:1,Tesla,esg

"New DelhiNew Delhi, July 7 -- After being dragged to court by Elon Musk's electric vehicle giant over the use of the 'Tesla' trademark, Gurugram-based company Tesla Power India Pvt. Ltd is confident about settling the trademark infringement dispute with the American giant through mediation.Kavinder Khurana, managing director of Tesla Power, in an interaction with Mint, stated that his company is confident it can mediate with Tesla Inc. If mediation fails, they are prepared to fight the legal battle with the American EV giant and are confident they will not lose the Tesla trademark.""We are confident that we will be able to mediate and settle the matter through mediation. Our intention is to resolve the matter, which is why we voluntarily surrendered in court on the first day and gave an undertaking that we will not engage in the EV business with the Tesla trademark,"" he said.Regarding the possibility of failed mediation and concerns about losing the trademark, Khurana stated that they trust the court not to take away the Tesla trademark from them. He emphasized they are not afraid to fight this battle against Tesla.""We believe that the courts in India are fair in their decisions. If, somehow, an honorable court decides that we cannot use it, we will respect that decision. We have a business in India, and we will explore remedies to address that situation. But right now, we are confident that the honourable court will not instruct us to stop using this brand name or trademark because it is our identity,"" he said.""I have obtained all the necessary approvals and paid over Rs.60 crore in taxes to the Indian government, including goods and services tax (GST). We have fulfilled all our tax obligations. Why should I be scared?"" Khurana said.According to Khurana, the legal suit has not impacted the business of the company, and they remain profitable.However, Khurana insists that Tesla should directly participate in the mediation process without relying on third parties like law firms. He expresses concern that if third parties involved in the mediation lack the intent to mediate and settle, it could complicate reaching a resolution. Therefore, Tesla Power plans to request Tesla Inc. to send its own representative to the mediation proceedings. Khurana notes that Tesla Inc. has not directly contacted them so far.Khurana further expressed skepticism that only their company is targeted by Tesla when there are numerous companies registered in India with the Tesla trademark. He pointed out that Tesla Inc. was aware of other companies using 'Tesla' without objection when they applied for their trademark in India.""When Tesla Inc. applied for their trademark in India, they were aware that other companies, including ours, were already using 'Tesla' without objection. It seems they've chosen this moment, just as we're on the verge of becoming profitable. Until now, we've been incurring losses to grow our business legally under the Tesla name. It's puzzling why they've singled us out now,"" he added.When asked about why he chose to name his company Tesla, Khurana explained that the word ""TESLA"" originates from the surname of the renowned scientist Nikola Tesla, not invented by Tesla Inc. or Elon Musk. He mentioned that Musk chose this name as a tribute to Nikola Tesla. Khurana pointed out that there are numerous companies worldwide using the name, including 300 in the US, 700 globally, and 14 in India.""We obtained approval for Tesla Power USA LLC from the government of Delaware, USA, and similarly established Tesla Power USA MENA LLC in Dubai, UAE. In India, we received approval for Tesla Power India Pvt. Ltd from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. Additionally, we obtained a No Objection Certificate from the Trademark Registry in India and secured worldwide copyright for our logo design. Leveraging these approvals, we have extensively advertised our brand name and copyrighted logo across multiple countries.""He also notes that their logo is distinct and bears no similarity to any trademark owned by Tesla Inc., and Tesla Power has invested significantly, spending crores of rupees on advertising campaigns to promote their brand and trademark, ensuring widespread recognition among the public.Tesla Inc., co-founded by Elon Musk, filed a lawsuit against Tesla Power on 2 May, alleging trademark infringement and consumer confusion. Tesla Inc. accused the Gurugram-based company of misleading consumers by implying an association with its electric vehicles (EVs), which could potentially damage its reputation as it prepared to enter India.Tesla Power EV adsIn response, the High Court restrained Tesla Power from publishing promotional advertisements featuring EV products under the Tesla trademark, following Tesla Inc.'s plea.Tesla Inc. alleged in their plea to the Delhi court that Tesla Power not only used a similar trademark but also advertised itself as an EV company in newspapers. Despite undertaking on 2 May to refrain from selling anything related to EVs, Tesla Power continued to sell e-scooters bearing the Tesla logo, which Tesla Inc. claimed violated the court's order. The American company reiterated in subsequent hearings that Tesla Power's e-scooters were still available for purchase on IndiaMart, contrary to the court's directives.Tesla Power argued in response that its primary business was supplying lead-acid batteries for applications such as automobiles, inverters, and UPS systems, and that it was not involved in manufacturing EVs. The company said advertisements featuring the Tesla name were part of a marketing alliance with another EV manufacturer, E-Ashwa, and that it had no intention of producing or marketing EVs under its own brand.Regarding the sale of e-scooters, Tesla Power acknowledged that its partners and dealers had sold 700 units, totaling around Rs.5 crore, bearing the Tesla trademark. The sales were primarily conducted by their partner company, E-Ashwa.Khurana informed Mint that they had completely terminated their alliance with E-Ashwa due to the court's directive prohibiting any involvement in the EV business.""As of May 2nd, we ceased all EV-related operations and terminated all engagements with E-Ashwa. Termination notices have been issued, and we are currently settling accounts and inventory. We have instructed dealers to remove Tesla Power USA stickers from remaining inventory; most stickers have already been removed, though a few may still remain. While we cannot guarantee 100% completion immediately, we are actively working to comply with the court's orders. Additionally, we have already emailed IndiaMart to remove the product,"" he said.Tesla Power, operational since 2020 primarily in India, focuses on lead-acid batteries for two-wheelers and four-wheelers, inverters, UPS systems, and also offers alkaline water purifiers and engine lubricants. It serves over a million customers, collaborates with 500 plus channel partners, and operates through 5,000 plus dealers, according to the company. Since inception, Tesla Power has conducted business exceeding Rs.250 Crore. Apart from India, Tesla Power operates in 12 other countries across the Middle East, Asia, and Africa.

US jobs growth slowed in June and unemployment edged up. Welcome to Trading at Noon. I'm Elena Casas. The US economy added 206,000 jobs in June, while May's data was revised sharply down to 218,000 rather than the previously reported 272,000. Unemployment, meanwhile, came in at 4.1%, and that slight rise has been interpreted by markets as a boost to the chances of a September rate cut. Wage growth also helps that case. Wages grew 3.9% in the three months through June, the smallest gain in three years. One analyst told Reuters earlier that's good news for the Fed.
I think the data is good enough for the market to reinforce the soft-landing narrative. At the same time, it's probably weak enough for the Fed to keep all of their options open, including the September meeting where they will be considering a cut.
That wage number is seen as consistent with the move towards the Fed's 2% inflation target. The next key data point now is June's CPI data are out on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters, though, are predicting it comes in at 3.4%, that's exactly the same as the month before. Despite that, market bets on a September rate cut have increased to about 72% after the June jobs report. That's pushed yields on the 10-year Treasury down, leaving them around 15 basis points lower for the week. That has boosted the NASDAQ, while all three major Wall Street indexes remain on course for weekly gains. Those mega-cap stocks have strengthened in early trading. Shares of Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms all gaining around 0.4% this morning. Those recent rallies will be put to the test next week as earnings season kicks off. JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup all report second-quarter earnings on Friday. Well, Tesla's shares are set to turn positive for the year, extending their gains for an eighth consecutive session. Stocks of the electric vehicle giant have slowly rebounded after major staff reductions were announced months ago. Crypto-linked stocks including Coinbase, Riot Platforms, and Marathon Digital are following Bitcoin lower as the currency slumped to a more than four-month low. Meanwhile, oil prices held steady near two-month highs. They're on track for a fourth week of gains. Despite growing concerns over the incoming hurricane season, shrinking US inventories have upped bets for a summer rally. Well, that's Trading at Noon.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

US job growth likely slowed in June. Welcome to your US Morning Call. I'm Elena Casas. The US economy is forecast to have added 190,000 jobs in June. That would be much lower than May's 272,000 but still a healthy number. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4% in a sign the US remains on course for a soft landing. Investors will also pay close attention to wage growth, forecast to rise at its slowest rate in three years, which could boost Fed policymakersâ confidence that they are beating inflation. Those numbers are out at 1:30PM Eastern. Ahead of that, the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ are coming off record closing highs on Wednesday before the 4th of July holiday. Data earlier in the week led traders to add to their bets of a Fed rate cut coming in September, now seen at 58%. New York Fed President John Williams said this morning the US economy is ""doing remarkably well"" but still has a way to go to reach the 2% inflation goal. Ahead of payrolls data, the Dollar was at a three-week low, while the British Pound has firmed as the Labour Party surged to a landslide election victory. The meanwhile, the Euro is on track for its biggest weekly gain against the Dollar this year, as polls predict a hung parliament in France following Sunday's vote, rather than a majority for the far-right. Shares of Macy's rose 2.6% in premarket trading on reports of a raised buyout offer. Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management sweetened their offer to $2.6 billion for the department store chain, the WSJ reported yesterday. Tesla has been granted approval to expand its Gigafactory on the outskirts of Berlin. The US electric vehicle giant has been allowed to begin construction by authorities despite the risk of resistance from local residents. Shares continue to build from the six-month high they hit on Wednesday. Rumors President Biden could drop out of the race continue after prominent donors expressed doubts. CNBC reported that the heiress to the Disney family fortune, a prominent party backer, said that she will no longer fund the Democratic Party until Biden drops out. The President's next unscripted test will be a television interview conducted by ABC this evening. Yesterday, he has this to say:
You got me, man. I'm not going anywhere.
Oil prices are trading near a two-month high and are headed for a fourth week of gains.

"New DelhiNew Delhi, July 4 -- The Delhi High Court on Thursday referred a trademark infringement case involving Tesla Inc and Tesla Power for mediation after the two companies agreed to try and settle their dispute through this route.A senior mediator of the Delhi High Court Mediation and Conciliation Centre will take up the matter starting July 18. If the mediation fails, a bench of the court will hear the case on September 18.Chander Lall, a senior lawyer representing Tesla Inc, told the court on Thursday that mediation might not be effective because Tesla Power would not relinquish its brand.""Mediation will not work when it comes to their brand-they are not going to give it up,"" Lall said.In response, lawyer J. Sai Deepak, representing Tesla Power, said, ""We are open to mediation.""Tesla Inc, the US electric vehicle giant co-founded by Elon Musk, sued Tesla Power India Pvt Ltd on May 2, accusing the Gurugram company of infringing on its trademark and misleading consumers by implying an association with its EVs. Tesla Inc. claimed this caused confusion among customers and potential damage to its reputation as it looked to enter the Indian market.Lall reiterated that Tesla Power was not abiding by the court's orders and that it continued to sell e-scooters on IndiaMart. He also said that people had called him up personally, alleging cheating by Tesla Power.""They say they have been charged lakhs of rupees and then abandoned,"" Lall said.According to Sai Deepak, Tesla is not a unique trademark as there are many companies and registrations with this name in India, Taiwan and other countries.""Therefore, for someone to come out and say that because of Elon Musk, we are the only ones who are entitled to claim Tesla and a monopoly over it, frankly speaking, doesn't fly,"" he said.On May 30, Tesla Power informed the court that it had instructed its partners and vendors to remove the Tesla logo from their electric scooters to comply with a May 2 Delhi High Court order prohibiting the sale and promotion of products bearing the Tesla trademark. Tesla Power clarified that it had no intention to market its electric scooters under the Tesla brand.The Indian company said 699 e-scooters bearing the Tesla trademark had been sold by its partners and dealers so far. Tesla Power's partner company, e-Ashwa, was mostly responsible for selling the e-scooters.The court instructed Tesla Power to take further steps to comply with its orders and refrain from engaging in any EV business using the Tesla trademark.The US company informed the court that Tesla Power was selling e-scooters with the Tesla logo even after undertaking on May 2 that it would not sell anything related to EVs. Tesla Inc. had claimed that the Indian company had violated the court's order.On May 2, the Delhi High Court restrained Tesla Power from publishing promotional advertisements featuring EV products under the Tesla trademark, following the plea from Tesla Inc. It claimed Tesla Power not only had a similar trademark but also advertised itself as an EV company in newspapers. It said consumers were mistakenly buying Tesla Power batteries, assuming they were associated with the US company, and sending complaints to Tesla Inc.Tesla Power argued in response that its primary business was supplying lead-acid batteries for applications such as automobiles, inverters, and UPS systems, and that it was not involved in manufacturing EVs.

It aims to launch affordable vehicles, transition into an AI company and is banking on its ""robotaxi"" venture.The successful introduction of its Full Self Driving (FSD) software in China amid stiff competition marks a significant win. Additionally, TSLA’s Energy Generation and Storage business is thriving.

BYD closes the gap on Tesla. Welcome to Asia Markets Briefing. I'm Ramzan Karmali. BYD posted a 21% rise in Q2 EV sales. Between April and June the Chinese firm sold over 426,000 cars, around 12,000 fewer than its American rival. BYD handed back the title of the world's top EV vendor to Tesla in Q1. Tesla is expected to report a 6% fall in April to June deliveries later today. On to the markets now, and shares across the region were in the main subdued. It was a bit of a mixed bag for Chinese stocks as investors weighed domestic recovery and awaited stimulus signals in the upcoming policy meetings. Meanwhile, the Nikkei was boosted by financial stocks. On speculation that the Bank of Japan might raise interest rates again in the near future amid a weakening Yen. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to speak later in the day at an event hosted by the ECB. Sources have told Reuters that four of Japanâs biggest insurers and other financial firms plan to sell around JPY500 billion, that's $3.1 billion worth of shares in Honda. Tokio Marine, Sompo, and two units of MS&amp;AD Insurance are expected to offload shares. Shares in Hong Kong listed Chinese property companies surged on Tuesday after private data showed yearly sales declines for major Chinese property developers continue to narrow in June. Sales value at China's top 100 real estate developers fell 16.7% in May from a year ago, narrowing from the 33.7% annual decline in the previous month. The market is closely watching the impact a major government package of support measures launched in mid-May would have on stabilizing the country's ailing property sector. South Korea's consumer inflation weakened to an 11-month low in June as supply side pressures eased. CPI rose by a less than forecast 2.4% in June, down from Mayâs 2.7% reading. Like most Asian currencies, the Won continued to slip today against a firmer US Dollar. A workerâs union at Samsung Electronics in South Korea has called a three-day strike starting next Monday. That's according to a union official. The Union wants a more transparent system for bonuses and time-off and wants the company to treat it as an equal partner. Samsung declined to comment on the unionâs strike plan. Oil prices were fairly stable today. They're holding near two-month highs they reached yesterday. That's on expectation for rising fuel demand from the summer travel season and a possible rate cut in the US that could boost economic growth. And coming up on the economic front on Wednesday, a number of countries across the region will be releasing service sector PMI data. India's service sector is likely to shine brightest. Economists polled by Reuters expect the June reading to come in again over 60. Don't forget any reading above 50 signifies expansion. And that's it, from your Asia Markets Briefing.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

Description: Megacap growth stocks led by Apple and Tesla lifted the tech-heavy Nasdaq to a higher close on Monday, while the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 also eked out slight gains in light pre-July 4th holiday trading. Lisa Bernhard has more.

Wall Street's main indexes ended higher on Monday, with the NASDAQ notching the biggest gains thanks to mega-cap tech stocks. The Dow ticked up into the green, the S&amp;P 500 added about a 0.25%, and the NASDAQ climbed more than 0.80%. Data from the Institute for Supply Management showed manufacturing contracted for a third straight month in June, while prices paid by manufacturers dropped to a six-month low. Both are encouraging signs for the Federal Reserve's battle against inflation. Also scheduled for this week are JOLTS job openings data on Tuesday, and the non-farm payrolls report on Friday. Traders have stuck to their bets of around two interest rate cuts from the Fed this year, according to LSEG's FedWatch. But Matt Stucky, Chief Portfolio Manager for Equities at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management, said he's less optimistic.
We think at this point in the economic cycle, inflation is somewhat sticky, demonstrated by still an elevated wage environment that's not consistent with the Fed's 2% inflation goal. Wages need to be somewhere between 3% and 3.5%. The latest update that we've seen for the month of May with the payroll report was that wages are about 4.2% up year-on-year.
Stocks on the move included Apple, which rose nearly 3%, while Amazon and Microsoft both added more than 2%. Shares of Tesla surged 6% ahead of second-quarter vehicle delivery data. JPMorgan Chase shares gained more than 1.5% to hit an all-time high after the biggest US bank on Friday hiked its dividend and the board authorized $30 billion in share buybacks. And shares of Chewy dropped more than 6.5%, reversing sharp early gains, after stock influencer Keith Gill, also known as ""Roaring Kitty"", disclosed a 6.6% stake in the pet products retailer.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

Description: Wall Street made a choppy start to the second half of the year, but the focus this week is on the labor market with the release of key data - starting on Tuesday with the JOLTS job openings survey.

Video Transcript:
Mega caps lift the NASDAQ at the start of a week dominated by jobs data. Welcome to your US Markets Briefing. I'm Elena Casas. Wall Street got off to a mixed start to the second half of the year. Big Tech rose, as did the banking sector, but overall trading volumes were low in a holiday-shortened week. Data showed factory activity contracted for a third straight month in June, although prices paid came in at a six-month low, in a sign inflation is falling towards target. This week, though, the focus is on the other side of the Fed's mandate: employment. JOLTS data out tomorrow is forecast to show 7.91 million job openings in May, down from 8.05 million the month before. While June's crucial non-farm payrolls data are out on Friday is predicted to show the US economy added 190,000 jobs, down from May's 272,000. One strategist told me earlier, this week's unemployment numbers may come in higher and that could give the Fed cover for a rate cut.
I think we're getting greater confidence that inflation is moving towards that 2% target. However, the concern now flips to the labor market side and if we get additional softening there and the unemployment rate starts to move higher, the Fed might have to refocus and move a little bit more towards the job side of the market, which probably gives them more cover to actually cut rates between now and the end of the year. So that labor mandates really, I think, shifting the focus for the Fed going forward.
Tesla's deliveries are expected to have fallen for the second straight quarter, when the company publishes that data tomorrow. It's dealing with both low demand and tough competition from cheaper Chinese EV-makers. Tesla's stock has lost 0.25% of its value this year amid doubts from some investors over Elon Musk's strategy. Regulators in France are preparing to charge NVIDIA with breaches of antitrust law, sources told Reuters, following dawn police raids last September. The company could, in theory, risk a fine of as much as 10% of its global annual turnover. And the Supreme Court has ruled that Donald Trump is immune to prosecution for official acts he took as president, although not for unofficial ones, in a decision that is likely to significantly set back the attempt to prosecute him for his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election. The case will be sent back to a lower court, but the chance of Trump facing trial again before November's election now seem remote. And that's your US Markets Briefing.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

"SAN FRANCISCO - Tesla filed a response Thursday disputing a wrongful-death lawsuit from the wife of a Tesla employee killed in a fiery 2022 crash. The initial suit seeking damages from Tesla was filed last month in the U.S. District Court in Colorado and alleges that the company sold the employee a defective car and exaggerated the capabilities of its assisted driving features.Tesla's response submitted Thursday states that the company ""disputes that it is liable for any damages whatsoever,"" and requests that the case be moved from state to federal court.A Washington Post investigation in February highlighted evidence that Hans von Ohain, a Tesla recruiter, was using his Tesla Model 3's so-called Full Self-Driving feature when it barreled into a tree in Evergreen, Co., and exploded in flames. That potentially makes him the first documented fatality linked to the most advanced driver assistance technology offered by the company. After Tesla initially declined to comment on The Post's reporting, CEO Elon Musk later wrote in a post on X that von Ohain did not have the Full Self-Driving feature downloaded onto his car, without providing evidence for that claim.Tesla and Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.The suit filed by Nora Bass, von Ohain's wife, in May is the latest legal challenge to Tesla alleging that a fatal or serious crash occurred while a driver was relying on technology Musk has made central to the automaker's brand. Full Self-Driving and another assisted driving feature, Autopilot, control steering and other actions typically left to the human behind the wheel.Musk has said he will unveil a fully autonomous taxi called the ""Cybercab"" in August but has provided few details. Meanwhile, Tesla is fighting at least eight other lawsuits - in addition to the Colorado case - that allege flaws in its assistive driving technology and are headed to trial in the next year. The Colorado crash is also one of hundreds involving Tesla vehicles investigated by federal or state officials for the role the company's assistive driving technology may have played in a collision.On Thursday, Tesla filed a motion to move the case from the District Court of the State of Colorado to federal court. The company argued that the case qualified for federal court because the two sides are from different states and Bass is seeking damages above $75,000. Attorneys for Bass declined to disclose the total amount they were seeking.""We stay committed to advocating fiercely for the von Ohain family, ensuring they receive the justice they deserve,"" said Jonathan Michaels, Bass's attorney, in a statement. The suit refers to the crashed vehicle's driver assist features only as Autopilot, but Michaels says it was intended as a ""catchall"" to refer to all the car's automation technology, including Full Self-Driving.In previous cases filed against Tesla, the company has said it is not liable for the crashes or deaths because the driver is ultimately in control of the vehicle. But that contention is coming under increased scrutiny from the spate of lawsuits and federal regulators. In April, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the name Autopilot ""may lead drivers to believe that the automation has greater capabilities than it does."" The agency's comments came as it opened another probe into the technology after concerns that a sweeping December recall did not go far enough to address driver inattention.Critics say that Tesla's marketing and lofty promises made by Musk naming the assisted driving features Full Self-Driving and Autopilot give drivers a false sense of confidence about taking their eyes off the road, or getting behind the wheel after drinking. In the suit filed by Bass, her lawyers argue that if the technology ""operated properly, the vehicle would not have veered off the road, collided with a tree, burst into flames, and Hans Von Ohain's gruesome and painful death would have been avoided.""Michaels, the attorney, said the car was also defective because of the intensity of the fire that ensued after von Ohain hit the tree, which ultimately caused his death. Colorado State Patrol Sgt. Robert Madden, who oversaw the agency's investigation into the crash, told The Post in an interview that it was one of ""the most intense"" vehicle fires he had ever seen, and that von Ohain likely would have survived the impact of the crash alone.The suit does not mention that von Ohain was drinking in the hours leading up to the crash, and died with a blood alcohol level of more than three times the legal limit in Colorado, according to an autopsy conducted by the Clear Creek County Coroner's office. The surviving passenger, Erik Rossiter, who registered a similar blood alcohol level after the crash, said von Ohain seemed composed and ""by no means intoxicated"" as they got in the Tesla and headed home from a day at the golf course. Michaels said he plans to challenge the validity of von Ohain's toxicology reading in court.Because of the intensity of the fire, state investigators were unable to access data from the car. Tesla told Colorado state police that it could not confirm whether a driver-assistance system had been in use because it ""did not receive data over-the-air for this incident,"" according to the state investigative report.Bass said in interviews that von Ohain received the Full Self-Driving feature with his employee discount and used it nearly every time he got behind the wheel. She said its driving could be ""jerky"" and unreliable, but that her husband considered Musk a ""brilliant man"" and was passionate about training futuristic technology so that it could one day revolutionize the way society gets around. ""We knew the technology had to learn, and we were willing to be part of that,"" she said.Tesla owners have long complained of occasionally erratic behavior by the cars' software, including sudden braking and missed road markings. Rossiter, the passenger, told investigators and The Post that the car struggled to navigate the mountain curves on their way to the golf course the morning of the crash, forcing von Ohain repeatedly to yank it back on course.Before representing Bass, Michaels brought one of the first major Autopilot cases in front of a jury last year in Riverside, Calif., but Tesla ultimately prevailed.In recent months, Tesla has shown a fresh willingness to settle some legal cases alleging failings in its assisted driving technology, despite Musk's vow on Twitter in 2022 to never settle ""an unjust case against us even if we will probably lose."" Just this year, the company has settled at least two wrongful death lawsuits.Copyright (c) 2024 The Washington Post",2024-06-29,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240629:nNRAt42tc1:1,Tesla,esg

"Ford flags the F-150's transmission; Tesla cites wiper, trim concernsPickup trucks from two high-profile brands are being recalled over transmission, windshield wiper and exterior trim issues.Ford is recalling more than 552,000 pickup trucks in the United States because of a transmission issue that can cause the vehicles to abruptly downshift into first gear. Meanwhile, electric-vehicle maker Tesla has issued two recalls on more than 11,000 Cybertrucks because of potential problems with the windshield wipers and exterior trim.The Ford recall affects certain 2014 model year F-150 trucks. Downshifting can cause rear tires to slide or lock up until the truck slows down, which could cause drivers to lose control of their vehicles and increase the risk of a crash.The F-150 has been the top-selling truck in the United States for decades.In documents posted Tuesday by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Ford said a signal loss between the transmission sensor and powertrain control module was responsible for the problem.NHTSA regulators relayed two injury complaints related to the transmission issue to Ford, company spokesperson Maria Buczkowski said.Ford expects a fix to be available in the third quarter of this year, Buczkowski said. Owners can expect notification letters in the mail after July 1, NHTSA documents said.F-150 owners who experience the downshifting problem before the wider fix is available can take their vehicles to dealers for service, Buczkowski said. They also can use mobile service or pickup and delivery for repair, Buczkowski said.An excessive electrical current could cause the front windshield wiper to fail on more than 11,000 Cybertrucks, Tesla said in NHTSA documents.The other recall of Cybertrucks involves a piece of the trunk bed trim that could loosen and fly off, becoming a road hazard for others.

Tesla faces new worries over the quality of its Cybertrucks. The firm has recalled more than 11,000 of the electric pickups in the US. Thatâs over issues with windshield wipers and loose trim. Analysts say itâs no big surprise about the wipers, which have long been identified as a problem. The Cybertruckâs unusual design forced Tesla to fit huge blades, putting a bigger strain on the motors that move them. Now, the problems feed into a perception of wider issues with the vehicles. One analyst told Reuters that the overall build quality of the Cybertruck was âquite poorâ. Tesla began delivering the Blade Runner-inspired pickup in late 2023, after years of delay. Itâs meant to answer critics who say the firm lacks new models. Mass production is expected to begin in 2025, and Musk has said the target is 200,000 units per year. Tesla hasnât revealed how many it has shipped so far however, and skeptics say it may lack mass-market appeal. While recalls of new car models arenât unusual, itâs relatively rare for Tesla, which often solves problems with over-the-air updates. It also looks sure to raise unwelcome new questions for the Cybertruck.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

"Craig Trudellin response to Tesla investors reapproving his massive compensation plan, Elon Musk offered outlandish predictions that he can enrich shareholders all over again.After Tesla's general counsel confirmed in mid-June that investors supported awarding stock options to Musk worth as much as US$55.8 billion (HK$435.24 billion), the chief executive officer said the company's robot-making effort may one day dwarf its car business.Tesla has all of two humanoid robot prototypes plucking battery cells off the end of a production line in California and placing them in shipping containers. ""Quite a few"" others are cruising around the company's offices in Palo Alto, Musk said during the company's annual meeting.The CEO isn't expecting the bot - called Optimus - to go into limited production until next year, when Tesla could put a few thousand to the test in its own factories.He nevertheless offered a pie-in-the-sky projection that Tesla may one day make around US$1 trillion of profit annually from the product, without offering a time frame.""If the price-to-earnings multiple is, say, I don't know, 20 or 25, something like that, that would mean a US$20 trillion market cap from Optimus alone,"" Musk said. ""It's within the realm of possibility for Tesla to achieve a valuation 10 times that of the most valuable company today.""Work on robots was at the center of an ultimatum Musk laid down earlier this year.The CEO openly pressured Tesla's board to boost his stake in the company to around 25 percent, saying that he otherwise preferred to build artificial intelligence and robotics products elsewhere.Musk has a long track record of setting stretch goals, and a spotty history of achieving them on time - if at all. While he was proven correct, for example, when he said in 2019 that the pursuit of self-driving technology could one day make Tesla a half-trillion-dollar company, his repeated predictions that Tesla is on the verge of turning its customers' cars into robotaxis haven't panned out.This also isn't the first business within Tesla that Musk has predicted will one day rival carmaking.The company continues to generate only a fraction of sales with its energy generation and storage products, years after the CEO said it could be roughly the same size as Tesla's automotive operations.Speaking of the auto business, Musk was much more measured.""It's tough sledding out there,"" he said, noting that General Motors, Ford Motor and other manufacturers have dialed back plans for electric vehicle production.""Now Tesla, we're gonna increase, but it is not an easy market.""bloomberg news (tns)Copyright © 2024 GC Media Teamwork Limited",2024-06-25,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240625:nNRAt2o9bi:1,Tesla,esg
"Pickup trucks from two high-profile brands are being recalled over transmission, windshield wiper and exterior trim issues.Ford is recalling more than 552,000 pickup trucks in the United States because of a transmission issue that can cause the vehicles to abruptly downshift into first gear. Meanwhile, electric-vehicle maker Tesla has issued two recalls on more than 11,000 Cybertrucks because of potential problems with the windshield wipers and exterior trim.The Ford recall affects certain 2014 model year F-150 trucks. Downshifting can cause rear tires to slide or lock up until the truck slows down, which could cause drivers to lose control of their vehicles and increase the risk of a crash.The F-150 has been the top-selling truck in the United States for decades.In documents posted Tuesday by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Ford said a signal loss between the transmission sensor and powertrain control module was responsible for the problem.NHTSA regulators relayed two injury complaints related to the transmission issue to Ford, company spokesperson Maria Buczkowski said.Ford expects a fix to be available in the third quarter of this year, Buczkowski said. Owners can expect notification letters in the mail after July 1, NHTSA documents said.F-150 owners who experience the downshifting problem before the wider fix is available can take their vehicles to dealers for service, Buczkowski said. They also can use mobile service or pickup and delivery for repair, Buczkowski said.An excessive electrical current could cause the front windshield wiper to fail on more than 11,000 Cybertrucks, Tesla said in NHTSA documents.The other recall of Cybertrucks involves a piece of the trunk bed trim that could loosen and fly off, becoming a road hazard for others. The adhesive that holds the trim piece may have been installed improperly, Tesla said in NHTSA documents.The company plans to replace wiper motors and rework the trim pieces to stay on. Cybertruck owners will receive notification letters related to both recalls starting Aug. 18.Tesla is not aware of any crashes or injuries related to the wiper and trim issues, it said in NHTSA documents.Tesla has issued four Cybertruck recalls since the vehicle went on sale in November, including a recall of about 3,800 vehicles in April over risk of a jammed accelerator pedal.Although the number of Cybertrucks on the road remains relatively low compared with more established truck brands, the Tesla vehicle has drawn an outsize amount of attention for its design.Copyright (c) 2024 The Washington Post",2024-06-25,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240625:nNRAt2mgj7:1,Tesla,esg

"IF YOU cannot stomach defending a billionaire's right to make more money, you'd best avert your eyes now. Perhaps you can raise them heavenward -- you will be in good company with Tesla shareholders and other corporate rubberneckers as they contemplate the debacle of Elon Musk's pay package.In January, Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick stood up for the little guy by nullifying Musk's US$56 billion pay package at Tesla. Turns out, the little guy didn't want any saving. On Jun 13, shareholders again overwhelmingly voted to award Tesla's chief executive the same pay package they'd approved in 2018. This, despite McCormick's finding earlier this year that the 2018 package was unfair because she'd considered two basic issues -- price and process -- and found them both problematic.It's fairly easy to get behind her dim view of Tesla's compensation approval process. Back in 2018, the independence of the compensation committee was laughable. One committee member had known Musk for 15 years and another had regularly vacationed with his family.The ""fair price"" issue, though, raises interesting questions. What yardstick do we use to find a US$56 billion payout ""unfathomable"", as McCormick had? The comparison multiples are quantitatively large, but outrage is qualitative. Also -- and this isn't McCormick's fault -- it seems a little belated to be fathoming ballooning CEO pay packages now; I suspect most market watchers ran out of fathoms many, many zeroes ago.In any case, the judge noted that Musk's pay package was ""historically unprecedented"", but hadn't Tesla's performance and sheer fact of existence been equally unparalleled? From March 2018 to end-2023, Musk achieved a total shareholder return of nearly 1,100 per cent, the company had argued.McCormick hadn't bought that, however, finding that Tesla had failed to prove that Musk's efforts had solely or directly led to the firm's success, or that his pay package had directly driven his efforts.Does this strike players of the white-collar Hunger Games as a little idealistic? Demanding a sole or direct causality disregards the Faustian pact that underpins the corporate world -- in return for getting all the bucks, the buck stops with you. You receive both credit and blame, however far removed you are from actual events. That's the deal.Then, there is the deal that Tesla shareholders made six years ago, when they wagered that Musk couldn't achieve certain targets in exchange for this ""unfathomable"" payout. The judge said they didn't know what they were doing when they made that bet, so she unmade it for them.But in 2024, even with the extra information that the judge insisted they previously lacked, shareholders made their own calculations which resulted in a similar bet: Musk might walk if he doesn't get his money; few want to find out what a post-Musk Tesla looks like, so they will give him his money.So now that Tesla shareholders have shoved their chips back onto the table for the second time, what's next? It's possible that the courts find other flaws with the 2024 vote, and Musk's payout remains stymied. But past a point, players in the great game of capitalism should be free to make their own bets and potential mistakes. And even if the courts do not like how this game is played, they ought to eventually let the chips fall where they may.Copyright © 2024 SPH",2024-06-25,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240625:nNRAt29w81:1,Tesla,esg
"Tesla shareholders last week approved CEO Elon Musks $56 billion remuneration package for the second time at a crucial annual shareholder meeting. This approval follows a previous invalidation by a Delaware court earlier this year. The staggering sum of Musks compensation exceeds the total revenue of Tata Motors, which reported $52.44 billion (Rs 4.38 trillion) in revenue, according to a report by The Economic Times.Tata Motors FY24 earningsFor the financial year 2023-2024 (FY24), Tata Motors reported record revenues of Rs 4,37,900 crore ($52.44 billion), an all-time high Ebitda at Rs 62,800 crore ($7.52 billion), and a net profit of Rs 31,800 crore ($3.8 billion). In Q4 FY24, the company posted revenues of Rs 1.20 trillion, marking a 13.3 per cent year-on-year increase. The consolidated net profit for the quarter ending March 31, 2024, reached Rs 17,529 crore, a 46 per cent jump from the Rs 12,033 crore reported in the same period the previous year.Elon Musks pay package vs Indian firm revenuesThe Tesla chiefs compensation package not only surpasses Tata Motors but also eclipses the total revenues of other significant Indian entities, including:- Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) &gt; $52.09 billion- State Bank of India (SBI) &gt; $40.35 billion- Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) &gt; $29.04 billionHowever, it falls short when compared to the revenues of:- Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) &gt; $108.62 billion- Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) &gt; $96.10 billion- Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) &gt; $93.84 billion- Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) &gt; $77.54 billionElon Musk is presently the highest-paid CEOs in the world. According to data analysed for The Associated Press by Equilar, the media package for S&amp;P 500 US CEO in 2023 was $16.3 million. This makes the Tesla CEOs earnings at least 250 times greater, which was the same conclusion drawn by Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen St Jude McCormack, who struck down the package in January 2024.According to CEOWORLD magazine, here are the top five highest paid CEOs in the world and their earnings in 2023:1. Sundar Pichai (Alphabet): Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet, received a total compensation package valued at approximately $226 million. This included his annual salary of $2 million, security costs of $6 million, and stock awards amounting to $218 million.2. Hock Tan (Broadcom): Hock Tan, the CEO of Broadcom, was awarded a total compensation package of around $161.83 million, driven largely by long-term equity awards.3. Nikesh Arora (Palo Alto Networks): Nikesh Arora, CEO of Palo Alto Networks, received a total compensation of $151.43 million, marking a significant increase due to stock awards and incentives.4. Sue Y Nabi (Coty Inc): Sue Y Nabi, the CEO of Coty Inc., earned a total compensation package of approximately $149.43 million, reflecting substantial growth in her remuneration.5. Christopher Winfrey (Charter Communications): Christopher Winfrey, CEO of Charter Communications, received total compensation of $89.08 million.Elon Musks pay package and legal troublesElon Musks pay package, originally approved by investors in 2018, was struck down by a Delaware judge earlier this year. However, at the companys annual shareholder meeting on Thursday, the proposal was approved as a resolution, potentially aiding the board in its legal battle against the court order.Even with shareholder approval, legal experts remain uncertain whether it will be sufficient to overturn the Delaware courts decision. Teslas regulatory filing in April indicated that shareholder backing might resolve the issue, especially after the court criticised the company for failing to disclose important details to shareholders.Teslas lawyers are scheduled to meet with the court in July.Tesla shareholder stance on Musks salaryOn Thursday, ahead of the final shareholder tally after Musk announced on X (formerly Twitter) that both the compensation and incorporation resolutions were on the way to passing by a wide margin.Musk faced opposition from some of its significant shareholders, such as Norways $1.7 trillion sovereign wealth fund, which owns 31.57 million Tesla shares, as well as the California Public Employees' Retirement System, which holds 9.5 million shares.The proposal, however, saw support from Baron Capital, holding 17.22 million shares, with founder Ron Baron stating in an open letter that Tesla is better with Elon. Tesla is Elon.Ahead of the shareholders vote, media reports indicated that there were concerns that rejection of the compensation proposal could harm Teslas stock price. Additionally, Musk had previously indicated he might continue his AI initiatives at other companies if the award was rejected, raising fears he might leave Tesla altogether.Tesla shares saw a slight increase of 0.1 per cent to $182.70 in extended trading on Thursday. Despite this, the stock has lost about a quarter of its value so far in 2024. The approval of Musks compensation package and the move to Texas mark significant developments for Tesla as it navigates financial challenges and a shifting regulatory landscape.(With inputs from agencies)Copyright (c) 2024 Business Standard Ltd.",2024-06-18,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240618:nNRAt01txx:1,Tesla,esg

Video Transcript:
The pay package for Elon Musk and Tesla is significant. One, it offers stability for a company where people were concerned, investors were concerned, what's going to happen. Because if that pay package had not been passed, he very well could have left the company. And that would have been disastrous for Tesla and disastrous for the stock. So, the pay package had actually been agreed upon years prior, based on metrics that Elon Musk had to make good on, and he had made good on all of those metrics. So, the fact is he should have been paid that amount. He jumped through all the hoops to make that happen. And he did do all that work. So, he now should be paid on that. It offers longer term stability for the company, as they navigate the current environment for EV, as they navigate growing competition, and yet Tesla is much more than a car manufacturer. So, I think this gives- paves the way for much more creativity, much more AI focus in the company. So, in my mind, it was a good thing that it survived with the pay package, and that it does offer stability for the company. I think that pushback that came from institutional investors is around just CEO pay packages in general. And yet I don't think you can say CEO packages in general. I think each company needs to look at their own metrics and what they're trying to accomplish and what the CEO needs to make. And let's not forget that he had not been paid over a long period of time. So, he hadn't been receiving these huge enormous pay. So, part of this is back pay that he is being paid now. So, I think it all needs to be taken in context. And we'll see what happens as a result of this with other companies.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

"DETROIT (AP) — A Tesla apparently operating on one of the company's automated driving systems crashed into a parked police vehicle Thursday near Los Angeles, narrowly missing an officer who was managing traffic at another crash.The Tesla driver told police in Fullerton, California, that he engaged the vehicle's ""self-drive"" system and used his cell phone, according to a police statement.The collision appears to be another in a long list of crashes in which Teslas using a partially automated driving system hit firetrucks or police cars parked on roads with flashing lights activated. In the Fullerton case, the officer also had put out flares, authorities said.Police said the crash is still under investigation, but called the California driver's conduct a ""clear violation of responsible driving practices and California law.""The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which has made Tesla recall its ""Full Self-Driving"" and ""Autopilot"" systems, said Friday it is aware of the crash and has contacted Tesla for more information.Although the driver told authorities he switched on ""self-drive"" mode, police said they have not confirmed whether he was using Tesla's ""Full Self-Driving"" or Autopilot systems. A message was left early Friday seeking comment from Tesla.Neither ""Full Self-Driving"" nor Autopilot can drive themselves, and Tesla tells owners that they must be ready to intervene at all times. ""Full Self-Driving,"" which is being tested on public roads by volunteer Tesla owners, can take on most driving functions, even on city streets, the company says. Autopilot is supposed to keep vehicles from hitting objects in front of them, and keep them centered in their lanes.Fullerton police said the officer saw the Tesla coming, and he and a police dispatcher who was riding with him were able to quickly move to the side of the road. ""A potential disaster was averted,"" police said in the statement.The Tesla driver stayed at the scene of the crash, which happened near an intersection at 12:04 a.m. Thursday. The driver is cooperating with police.Officers were investigating a fatal crash at the time the Tesla hit the police car, authorities said.""While there are no laws against the 'self-drive' mode, all rules and laws of the road still apply to the driver while controlling the vehicle,"" the statement said.NHTSA began investigating Autopilot crashes into emergency vehicles in 2021, but closed the probe in April after Tesla agreed to recall the software and boost its driver monitoring functions. Later NHTSA began investigating whether the company's recall actually worked.In documents explaining why the investigation was ended, NHTSA said it ultimately found 467 crashes involving Autopilot resulting in 54 injuries and 14 deaths.In addition, the agency found 75 crashes and one death involving ""Full Self Driving."" It's not clear whether the system was at fault. NHTSA last year made Tesla recall the software after finding that the system misbehaved around intersections and could violate traffic laws.CEO Elon Musk said Thursday at Tesla's annual shareholders meeting that the safety of ""Full Self-Driving"" is better per mile than human drivers, but he did not give full underlying data.Copyright © 2024 The Associated Press.

"Tesla's battle to reinstate Elon Musk's $45bn (£35bn) pay package is far from over, according to legal experts, despite shareholders backing the chief executive's remuneration deal.Investors in the electric carmaker re-ratified the pay deal on Thursday after it had been struck down by a judge in the US state of Delaware. The company's chair, Robin Deynholm has already pledged to ""put it back in front of the court"".However, doubts remain over whether Musk will be able to access the share-based package.The lawyer representing the Tesla shareholder Richard Tornetta, who brought the lawsuit that led to Musk's pay package being nullified, said in a statement on Thursday that the vote was ""deeply flawed"".""We believe that the ratification vote that Elon demanded and coerced is deeply flawed as a matter of law, legally ineffective and does not impact our case. We will respond to any arguments raised in due course,"" said Greg Varallo, a partner at the law firm Bernstein, Litowitz, Berger &amp; Grossmann.Judge Kathaleen McCormick threw out Musk's pay package in January, ruling that the board members had been insufficiently independent from the Tesla CEO while negotiating the package.Ann Lipton, a professor at Tulane law school, said the Tesla vote was ""unprecedented"" and the litigation around the deal would continue in Delaware, where Tesla was incorporated when the original pay deal was agreed in 2018.""It's simply not clear legally what the effect [of the vote] will be,"" said Lipton. ""Assuming there's no settlement, the litigation will continue before Chancellor McCormick. Tesla will argue that the new vote cures any defects in the original award and therefore Musk's pay is reinstated; the plaintiffs will argue it does not.""Any decision by McCormick is likely to be appealed against by the losing side and will go to the Delaware supreme court, said Lipton. ""At that point, the Delaware supreme court will have two issues before it: was McCormick right to strike the package originally? And if so, does the new vote restore the package?""Eric Talley, a professor at Columbia Law School, said comments by Musk in the run-up to Thursday's vote could be viewed as coercing shareholders, pointing to Musk threatening in January to build AI and robotics products outside the company if he did not gain enough voting control.""To the extent Tesla is going to use this vote as a reason to reverse the chancery court's holding, I'd expect a big argument,"" said Talley. ""In particular, there is a plausible argument that today's vote was the product of coercion … and thus not valid.""A Delaware court is likely to require Tesla to prove that the latest process was carried out independently from Musk and the vote was ""procedurally fair"", said Brian Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School.""This is an unprecedented situation, so it's important to keep in mind the pleading burdens are all against the board … this isn't done, yet,"" he said.Appearing in front of shareholders after winning the vote, Musk said: ""I just want to start off by saying, hot damn, I love you guys!""Thursday's Tesla shareholder meeting also voted in favour of moving Tesla's incorporation from Delaware to Texas, where the company is headquartered. However, litigation related to the pay package will remain in Delaware, according to McCormick, who wrote last month that she did not expect Tesla to ""litigate any matter related to this action anywhere but Delaware"".New pay packages for Musk will fall under the law of the company's new home, however, said Talley. ""Now that Tesla is reincorporating to Texas, going-forward decisions would fall under Texas law,"" he said.Copyright (c) 2024 theguardian.com-NonSyndicated",2024-06-14,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240614:nNRAsz01g8:21,Tesla,esg
"Billionaire tells shareholders 'hot damn, I love you guys' after retaining largest-ever executive pay package at US-listed firm• Musk's pay package not a done deal, say legal expertsTesla shareholders have approved a $45bn (£35.3bn) pay deal for CEO Elon Musk, following a fiercely contested referendum on his leadership.The result, announced on Thursday, comes as the billionaire tycoon fights to retain the largest-ever compensation package granted to an executive at a US-listed company.""I just want to start off by saying, hot damn, I love you guys!"" a gleeful Musk said as he appeared on stage following the vote.The vote took place after a Delaware judge nullified Musk's payment – then worth around $56bn (£43.9)– in January, on the grounds that Tesla's board could not be considered independent from Musk's influence and reached that dollar figure through an illegitimate process.The result is a victory for Musk and the Tesla board after they ardently campaigned for shareholders to approve the deal. It could serve as a rebuttal to the judge's ruling that struck down the award – making it easier for Tesla's board to argue that shareholders were properly informed about the payment package, and the board members' ties to Musk, before casting their votes.Tesla's board warned Musk could turn away from the company if the package wasn't approved, while Musk claimed on Wednesday evening that he had wide support of investors.Prominent shareholders such as Norway's sovereign wealth fund and the California State Teachers' Retirement System announced they would vote against the payment in the lead-up to the vote, while proxy advisory firms Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services also opposed the award.The vote does not automatically mean that Musk will receive the money, however, and there are likely to be further disputes. There are still numerous legal arguments around whether the board can be considered independent, and whether the package can be considered fair after the judge ruled otherwise.It is also possible new lawsuits may arise over the vote, potentially bringing the case back in front of a judge and raising the prospect of a protracted legal battle. Shareholders also approved a measure to move Tesla's legal home from Delaware to Texas, potentially further complicating any challenges.Tesla originally devised Musk's payment package in 2017, setting conditions for the CEO to receive 12 different tranches of stock options depending on whether the company hit certain revenue and market targets. Shareholders approved that package by a wide margin in 2018, but one investor filed a suit claiming that the board had been misleading and the package was unfair.Judge Kathaleen McCormick, who oversees Delaware's court of chancery, ruled that Tesla's board conducted a ""deeply flawed"" process to determine Musk's payment. McCormick found that the board was rife with personal conflicts and stacked with Musk's close allies, such as his former divorce attorney.Tesla's board, which is likely to appeal McCormick's ruling, sought to remedy her decision with a shareholder vote. Despite McCormick's criticism of the pay package, the board put forth the same deal that the judge rejected – albeit now worth less money due to a fall in Tesla's share price.Copyright (c) 2024 theguardian.com-NonSyndicated",2024-06-14,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240613:nNRAsyny2a:80,Tesla,esg

US stocks mixed but soft producer inflation data and chips strength buoys sentiment. Welcome to your US Markets Briefing. I'm Ludovica Brignola. Volatile nervous trading today as markets digest Wednesday's FOMC announcement and a second round of inflation data today. That said, the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ indices have been hovering near record highs with chipmakers supporting the NASDAQ. In today's data, PPI unexpectedly fell 0.2% month-on-month in May, that's compared with a 0.1% increase expected by economist polled by Reuters. And that came on the heels of softer-than-expected CPI data yesterday. That's why that, the Fedâs projections indicated there would be only one rate cut this year and here's why, according to an investor who spoke to us earlier.
The things that are driving the prices down, number one was energy, which could pop right back up depending on what happens to supply and demand. And the other thing was goods, it was mostly driven by goods. Services were still up. If that goods disinflation at some point stalls, we could have an upward surprise in the inflation print. And I think that is what the Fed is wary of.
US markets are also boosted by the chip sector today. Chipmaker Broadcom soared more than 14% on the NASDAQ to touch a record high. All that after the chipmaker raised its revenue forecast from semiconductors used in AI technology. It also announced a 10-for-1 forward stock split. NVIDIA is also up more than 3% and that in itself is boosting the performance of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, which touched an all-time peak today. Benchmark Treasury yields extended losses from the previous session, touching their lowest since early April has investors reconciled cooler-than-expected inflation data with tempered rate cut expectations. The Dollar edged higher against a basket of world currencies on the Fedâs hawkishness. Tesla shareholders will get to vote later today on whether they think CEO Elon Musk should receive the historic $56 billion pay package he was granted in 2018. But even if investors back the measure, the courts will have the last say. Tesla shares are up more than 3% today. All G7 countries will contribute to a loan package worth some $50 billion to Ukraine, backed by proceeds from immobilized Russian assets, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Thursday during the G7 meeting. The University of Michigan Sentiment Index out tomorrow could give a first indication of how robust consumer demand is ahead of key US retail sales data next week. The preliminary June reading is seen ticking up to 72 from 69.1 prior. And that's your US Markets Briefing.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

"Shortly after Tesla announced that shareholders re-approved Elon Musk's controversial, $50 billion pay package Thursday - and further solidified his place as one of the richest men in the world - the crowd at the annual shareholder meeting in Austin erupted in cheers as the elated CEO jumped in the air and took the stage.""Hot damn, I love you guys!"" he said, as his fans chanted: ""Elon! Elon!""It was a decisive outcome after months of uncertainty for the electric-vehicle maker, as Musk threatened to pull back from the company amid uncertainty shortly before the pay package was invalidated by a Delaware judge earlier this year.After his victory was announced, Musk spent nearly an hour making bold claims about the future of his company, declaring that it's about to embark on not just a ""new chapter"" but a ""new book.""""It's actually conceivable, and it's within the realm of possibility for Tesla to achieve a valuation 10 times that of the most valuable company today,"" he said. ""So when I say it's like we're starting a new book, it's going to be the best book.""A Delaware judge threw out the pay package, worth as much as $56 billion, earlier this year, arguing that the process that led to the deal had been unfair. As part of the deal, Musk was granted stock options as Tesla hit certain valuation milestones, accumulating massive amounts of shares that led to a record pay deal and played a hand in making Musk the richest person in the world.Musk, in a Wednesday night post on his social media platform, X, said the measure passed by a ""wide margin."" The final results were not immediately available Thursday.The shareholder vote does not immediately restore Musk's pay, but it sends a strong signal that he has the broad support of Tesla's investors. In a January post on X, Musk threatened to pull back from Tesla and build futuristic technology - such as robotics and artificial intelligence - ""outside of Tesla,"" before the invalidated pay package threatened to further erode his control. Such a future was a daunting prospect for the electric-vehicle maker, which reported a steeper-than-expected 55 percent plunge in profit for the first quarter.In the months leading up to the vote, investors large and small were split on whether to support the package. While some major shareholders criticized him as a distracted leader who doesn't deserve such a reward, others lauded him for being a generational genius.""Our answer is clear, loud and unequivocal: Tesla is better with Elon. Tesla is Elon,"" said Ron Baron, a billionaire and investor in Tesla, who added that Musk was indispensable to Tesla and that his compensation must recognize that fact.Investors and Musk's supporters, including X CEO Linda Yaccarino, applauded the results late Wednesday. Musk - who would have remained among the richest people regardless of whether he kept the pay package - also pledged in a post Wednesday night that he would make Tesla the most valuable company on Earth.Brad Lander, the New York City comptroller whose office owns about 3.4 million shares of Tesla and invests on behalf of public employees, said he voted against the package because of Tesla's struggles and Musk's divided attention among his several companies. Musk's Wednesday night tweet announcing the outcome, Lander said, was ""more evidence of the failure of corporate governance at Tesla.""""This is not how the votes are supposed to be counted and made public,"" he said. ""If this unprecedented pay package is approved, as long-term investors in Tesla, we expect a CEO who is deeply committed to the company's growth rather than other business ventures.""Ross Gerber, a longtime investor in Tesla and a vocal critic of Musk, said the results of the vote are great for Musk but do not address the company's current woes, including weak sales, global competition and mass layoffs.""If they put as much effort into selling cars … that would help,"" he said.Musk and a Tesla spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment late Wednesday.While several key investors were vocal about their position ahead of Thursday's meeting, others stayed silent, leaving the result unclear until Musk's X post late Wednesday. Tesla's largest investors - Vanguard Group, BlackRock and State Street, which collectively own about 17 percent of Tesla stock - did not publicly state their positions. None responded to requests for comment.After the decision from Delaware's Court of Chancery in January, Musk also unleashed on the state where Tesla - and many businesses - are incorporated.""Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware,"" he posted, before launching a poll and announcing a decision to hold a shareholder vote on incorporating in Texas instead.

Video Transcript:
Investors may have said yes to giving Elon Musk $56 billion again. In some ways, the enormous payout is so absurd it aligned shareholders with Musk. But months of high stakes hectoring revealed gross hypocrisy and changed the facts. The electric automakers boss might have won the vote, but he has proved why he shouldn't have. This mess started in January when a Delaware judge struck down a 2018 pay package awarded to Musk on the grounds that it was unfair to ill-informed shareholders. Tesla put the issue back to a vote, hoping to reiterate investors consent from six years ago to sway the legal case. As of now, those votes are still being tallied. But on Wednesday evening, Musk said in a post on social network X that a critical mass of shareholders had lodged their support. The pay packet was reasonable in its way. Sure, its magnitude seemed crazy, but so were the milestones Musk needed to hit, including growing market value 11-fold. Crucially fixing the impasse could have proceeded addressing other issues, and issues need addressing. Leave aside Tesla's strategic drift, or whether Musk appropriately balances the carmakers interests with his other companies. Instead, look at Tesla's executive departures: Drew Bellino, battery chief; Rebecca Tinucci, who led the company's charging network, Zach Kirkhorn, the finance chief one seen as Musk's potential heir. In a circular argument, Musk is now the crucial fulcrum on which Tesla rests by pure attrition. Yet despite it all, Tesla boasts an eye-popping valuation, one reinforced by Musk's inimitable presence. The strongest argument to support him is retaining that magic. But the fight against a loud chorus of dissenting shareholders reeks of hypocrisy and strengthens arguments that Musk's grip is too tight. Tesla launched a PR campaign to whip the vote with greater enthusiasm than it's ever marketed its own cars. Musk lambastic California's CalPERS, which said it is voting no, as having no honor. Board missives darkly implied that Musk has other places he could abscond to. Worst of all, it's still unclear whether a vote will actually sway Delaware that some shareholders had qualms about what they did six years ago after all this is reasonable. After all, Musk knows the feeling. After agreeing to buy Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, he tried to terminate the deal of a claims about inauthentic user numbers. He felt the facts had changed. His attempt failed, perhaps because of litigation, but shareholders are not bound by any contract to support him. Acting as if they are, is Tesla's weakest argument of all.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

"San Francisco Tesla shareholders are voting to approve a US$56 billion (S$75.5 billion) pay package for co-founder Elon Musk and to move its legal home to Texas, Mr Musk said on social media platform X on June 12, adding that the passage was by wide margins.Overwhelming shareholder approval of the largest remuneration terms in US corporate history could allay investor concerns about Mr Musk's future at the company while giving the electric carmaker ammunition in its fight to reverse a court decision to void the pay package.Mr Musk would still face a lengthy legal battle to convince the Delaware judge who said the Tesla board was ""beholden"" to him, while potentially fielding fresh lawsuits over the latest vote.""Even if the shareholders do approve the old package, it is not clear that the Delaware court will allow that vote to be effective,"" said UC Berkeley law professor Adam Badawi.The result will be announced at a meeting at Tesla's headquarters in Texas at 9.30pm GMT on June 13.A person familiar with the preliminary voting tally said a combination of big institutional investors and retail investor votes got the ""yes"" result over the line.Tesla shareholders also cast ballots on other proposals, including the move of Tesla's legal headquarters from Delaware to Texas, as well as the re-election of two board members: Mr Musk's brother Kimbal Musk and Mr James Murdoch, son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.Some investors viewed the vote on Mr Musk's pay as a test of confidence in his leadership. While he is undoubtedly Tesla's driving force and is credited with much of its success, the company has seen slowing sales and profits in the last few years.Tesla's stock has lost nearly 60 per cent of its value from its peak in 2021, when Mr Musk started selling billions of dollars worth of his stake partly to help finance his purchase of social media giant Twitter, sparking concerns that he would be spread too thin.He now runs six companies, including rocket-builder SpaceX, X -- formerly Twitter -- and the artificial intelligence (AI) company xA1, which Mr Musk created in 2023.Shareholders, led by major institutional investors, call such compensation far too generous for a leader who is splitting his time between six companies and is now presiding over falling sales and a strategic upheaval at Tesla.The pay package would enable Mr Musk to strengthen ownership ""at the expense of diluting the value of those belonging to other shareholders"", Ms Marcie Frost, chief executive of the California Public Employees' Retirement System, said on June 12.Tesla has been drumming up support for Mr Musk's pay package, especially from retail investors, who make up an unusually high percentage of its ownership base but who often do not vote.Company executives have posted messages on X, saying Mr Musk is critical to Tesla's success.The board said the world's richest person deserves the package because he hit all the ambitious targets on market value, revenue and profitability.The pay package is also needed to keep Mr Musk devoted to Tesla, the board said, even though the Delaware judge said the 2018 pay plan failed to make sure that Mr Musk committed a substantial amount of time to Tesla.Mr Musk has threatened to build AI and robotics products outside Tesla if he fails to gain enough voting control, which requires the 2018 pay package to be approved.The Delaware court that invalidated the compensation package had said the plan was proposed by a conflicted board with close personal and financial ties to its top executive.The board held the shareholder vote as a way to bolster its appeal of the ruling, in which the judge cited the board's failure to fully inform shareholders before approving the pay package in 2018.Tulane University corporate law professor Ann Lipton said: ""How the shareholders vote now doesn't really answer the question as to whether the board violated its duties in 2018, and that's the issue on appeal.""Mr Musk will have to wait months or years to get his pay package restored as appeals wind their way up to Delaware's Supreme Court.

For Musk to receive the pay package, the judge would have to change her ruling or she would have to be overruled in appeals court, according to Natela Shenon, a partner at the Los Angeles-based firm Grant Shenon, who specializes in complex business transactions and disputes.But the outcome of Thursday's vote ""should give Tesla the legal ammunition it needs to have the court officially reinstate it,"" she said.""The whole premise of the judge's ruling was that she felt the Tesla board was under Elon Musk's control and was not representing the best interests of the shareholders,"" Shenon said.

"Tesla shareholders voted to approve CEO Elon Musk's contested pay package, currently estimated to be worth more than $45 billion.The results were announced on a preliminary basis during Tesla's annual shareholder meeting, resulting in boisterous cheers from the investors in attendance. The decision comes after weeks of Musk and the company trying to gin up support through letters to shareholders, social media advertisements and incentives like Tesla factory tours.Board members say the vote should shore up Tesla's future by keeping Musk focused on the company. Musk has come under fire from some shareholders for being too distracted with his other ventures, which include SpaceX, the Boring Company, Neuralink, and the social media platform X.The pay package ""was, and fundamentally still is, about retaining Elon's attention and motivating him to focus on achieving astonishing growth for our company,"" board chair Robyn Denholm wrote in a June letter to shareholders.Why did Tesla hold a second pay package vote?The pay package initially passed a 2018 vote with 73% of voted shares in support, but a Delaware judge voided the compensation package earlier this year.Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Delaware Court of Chancery sided with a shareholder who challenged the package, describing it as an ""unfathomable sum"" that was unfair to shareholders. The shareholder who had filed the lawsuit took issue with Tesla's board, accusing its members – which include Musk's brother – of having too close of ties to the CEO.The vote does not automatically restore Musk's pay, but it does act as evidence that shareholders continue to approve the compensation package.Who voted in favor?More than 40% of Tesla's common stock is held by nonprofessional shareholders as of Thursday, according to data from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. That may have helped Musk's pay package win approval, since many of those shareholders are loyal Musk fans who want to see the CEO take the company from an EV manufacturer to a leader in AI and robotics.Musk has made clear he would be ""uncomfortable"" developing artificial intelligence at Tesla without boosting his current 13% stake in the company to 25%.""Shareholders at the end of the day knew that voting no would risk Musk potentially eventually leaving as CEO,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a Thursday note. ""The risk far overweighed the reward in voting no on this proposal despite some obvious frustration with Musk.""Tesla set to incorporate in TexasThe majority of all outstanding Tesla shares also voted in favor of moving Tesla's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company already operates a factory and hosts its corporate headquarters in the state.Musk has previously criticized Delaware and its courts, and earlier this year moved SpaceX's state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas.""If your company is still incorporated in Delaware, I recommend moving to another state as soon as possible,"" Musk said in a February post on X.Is Elon Musk overpaid? Why a Delaware judge struck down Tesla CEO's $55 billion payday.Just how big is this pay package?The pay package's value varies depending on Tesla's stock price, and was valued as high as $56 billion before stocks took a dip. The rewards are tied to Musk's ability to increase Tesla's market value.The median annual compensation for other Tesla employees last year was $45,811.Marcie Frost, CEO of the California Public Employees' Retirement System, called the compensation package ""exorbitant"" in a Wednesday press release.""The compensation is excessive when compared to executives at peer companies, highly dilutive to shareholders, and isn't tied to the long-term profitability of Tesla,"" Frost said in the statement.Tesla shares are down more than 50% from their peak in late 2021. The company has slashed car prices in recent months to address weakening demand and rising competition.Tesla share priceTesla shares jumped Thursday at the opening bell after social media posts from Musk indicated that shareholders were largely in support of the massive pay package.""Both Tesla shareholder resolutions are currently passing by wide margins!"" Musk said in a Wednesday night post on X, the social media company he purchased in 2022. ""Thanks for your support!!""The tweet was shared in a regulatory filing, along with other posts Musk interacted with that showed shareholder support – possibly because Musk's decision to share the tally before the polls had closed could be considered a solicitation of shareholder votes.Shares closed the day up 2.9% at $182.47.This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Musk discusses multibillion-dollar pay package vote at Tesla's annual shareholder meetingCopyright © 2024 GANNETT",2024-06-13,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240613:nNRAsyni0c:57,Tesla,esg

The result will be announced at the meeting at Tesla's headquarters in Texas late on Thursday.Ukraine US (BORGO EGNAZIA)US President Joe Biden and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy have signed a 10-year bilateral security agreement aimed at bolstering Ukraine's defence against Russian invaders.The agreement, signed on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Italy on Thursday, is meant to be a step towards Ukraine's eventual NATO membership, according to the text of the deal.""The parties recognise this agreement as supporting a bridge to Ukraine's eventual membership in the NATO alliance,"" the text says.Zelenskiy has long sought NATO membership but the allies have stopped short of taking that step. The Western alliance regards any attack launched on one of its 32 members as an attack on all under its Article Five clause.In the event of an armed attack or threat of such against Ukraine, top US and Ukrainian officials will meet within 24 hours to consult on a response and determine what additional defence needs are required for Ukraine, the agreement says.China Aust (CANBERRA)Australian rock lobster producers are hopeful a visit by Chinese Premier Li Qiang will result in an end to crippling sanctions on their exports.Beijing's second-in-command will visit Australia from June 15-18, the first trip by a Chinese premier in seven years.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has promised to raise points of contention with Mr Li, including the Chinese military's dangerous actions towards Australian Defence Force personnel in a number of incidents.Mr Li will start his visit in Adelaide, where he is expected announce an extension of the loan of two pandas at the city's zoo which was due to expire at the end of the year.During his stay in the South Australian capital, Mr Li will meet winemakers on Sunday and attend a lunch hosted by Foreign Minister Penny Wong and Trade Minister Don Farrell.Housing (CANBERRA)Home prices in Perth, Brisbane and Adelaide are growing much faster than in cities such as Melbourne and Hobart and the latest data indicates those trends could stick around for some time yet.Home values nationally have risen by more than 35 per cent since the pandemic kicked off in 2020 but growth has not been spread evenly, according to real estate data company CoreLogic.Price growth across hotspots Perth, Brisbane and Adelaide has vastly outpaced gains posted in other urban centres, including Hobart, Melbourne, Canberra, Darwin and Sydney.At one end of the spectrum, Perth has posted a 62.6 per cent increase in property values in that time, compared to an 11.2 per cent bump in Melbourne.Digging into the drivers behind the ""multi-speed"" housing market, CoreLogic head of research Eliza Owen said there were a number of factors at play.Energy (CANBERRA)Many of Australia's buildings fall outside the scope of a disclosure regime that the federal government intends to expand to better capture energy and emissions information.Non-residential buildings contribute about 10 per cent of total greenhouse gas emissions in the economy, meaning that reducing their carbon footprint could make a significant difference, according to Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy Jenny McAllister.Expanding an existing program would drive cost savings for business and significant emissions cuts in the commercial buildings sector, Senator McAllister will tell an industry audience on Friday.The commercial building disclosure (CBD) program requires energy efficiency information to be provided, in most cases, when commercial office space of 1000 square meters or more is offered for sale or lease.Moldova Russia (KYIV)The United States, Britain and Canada has accused Russia of carrying out a plot to influence the outcome of the Moldovan presidential election in October in a joint statement published by the US State Department.The statement on Thursday said Russia was seeking to exacerbate societal tensions and foment negative perceptions of the West and the incumbent team of Moldova's pro-Western President Maia Sandu, using disinformation and online propaganda.""We are taking this step to warn our democratic partners and Allies that Russian actors are carrying out a plot to influence the outcomes of Moldova's fall 2024 presidential election,"" it said.The Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The three governments said that Russia is supporting candidates for the presidency and that unidentified pro-Russia actors are ""actively using disinformation and propaganda online, on the air and on the streets to further their objectives.""US Abortion (WASHINGTON, D. C.)The US Supreme Court has rejected a bid by anti-abortion groups and doctors to restrict access to the abortion pill, handing a victory to President Joe Biden's administration in its efforts to preserve broad access to the drug.The justices, two years after ending the recognition of a constitutional right to abortion, ruled in a unanimous decision authored by conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh to overturn a lower court's decision to roll back Food and Drug Administration steps in 2016 and 2021 that eased how the drug, called mifepristone, is prescribed and distributed.The pill, given FDA regulatory approval in 2000, is used in more than 60 per cent of US abortions.The court ruled that the plaintiffs behind the lawsuit challenging mifepristone lacked the necessary legal standing to pursue the case, which required that they show they have been harmed in a way that can be traced to the FDA.G7 (BARI)Leaders of the Group of Seven major democracies have started their annual summit with many of them under a cloud at home but determined to make a difference on the world stage as they seek to help Ukraine and counter China's economic ambitions.Heading into two days of talks, diplomats said a deal had been agreed in principle on Thursday on plans to issue $US50 billion ($A75 billion) of loans for Ukraine using interest from Russian sovereign assets frozen after Moscow launched its invasion of its neighbour in 2022.Western nations were also unanimous in their concern over China's industrial overcapacity, which they say is distorting global markets, and their determination to help African states develop their economies, diplomats said.Legal: Russia Gershkovic (MOSCOW)Russian prosecutors say they have sent the case of detained US reporter Evan Gershkovich to court after concluding he had been collecting information for the US Central Intelligence Agency about a Russian tank factory.Gershkovich, 32, was arrested on March 29, 2023, in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg on charges of espionage that carry up to 20 years in prison after the FSB, the main successor agency to the KGB, said it had caught him ""red-handed"" trying to obtain military secrets.He denies any wrongdoing and his employer, the Wall Street Journal, said in a statement on Thursday after the latest Russian move that he was facing ""a false and baseless charge"" based on what it called ""calculated and transparent lies."" President Joe Biden has called his detention ""totally illegal"".Winkler (DUBLIN)Happy Days star Henry Winkler has thanked Irish firefighters following a blaze at his hotel in Dublin.The 78-year-old American actor, known for playing Arthur ""Fonzie"" Fonzarelli on the US sitcom, was staying at the prestigious Shelbourne Hotel when he was evacuated alongside other guests.On Twitter/X, he posted a picture alongside three fireman from Dublin Fire Brigade following emergency services attending the incident in the early morning on Wednesday.Winkler wrote: ""Thank you Dublin's fire department ... our hotel was evacuated on our first morning !!!""The Emmy-winner, also known for other comedy roles including playing acting teacher Gene Cousineau in hitman series Barry and Barry Zuckerkorn in Arrested Development, said he initially thought the fire alert was an alarm clock.In sport ...GOL OPEN (LONDON)A late birdie blitz from Patrick Cantlay has left Australia's early starters in the US Open in the American's slipstream on the opening day at Pinehurst Resort in North Carolina.Cantlay carded three late birdies en route to a sizzling five-under-par 65 that put him one shot clear of Masters runner-up Ludvig Aberg.Cantlay's round left Cam Smith, who was one-over after shooting a 71, six shots off the clubhouse lead. The 2022 British Open winner finished with his second birdie on a tricky Pinehurst No. 2 layout.Two shots further behind was Min Woo Lee, whose 73 included a double-bogey at the par-four eighth. Cam Davis was seven-over after double-bogeying the tenth - his first hole, half the field having started on the back nine.TEN MEN (LONDON)James Duckworth and Aleksandar Vukic have each pulled of one of the biggest wins of their careers to reach ATP 250 quarter-finals on the European grasscourt circuit.Duckworth beat world No.14 Ben Shelton in Stuttgart while Vukic defeated former top-10 player Karen Khachanov, now ranked 22, in s'-Hertogenbosch.It was Duckworth's third career win over a top-20 player and his best since defeating then-world No.13 David Goffin in Miami in 2021. A few months later that year he defeated Jannik Sinner, then No,15, now the No.1, in Toronto.Khachanov was Vukic's second highest-ranked victim having previously beaten Borna Coric, then ranked 15th, in Toronto last August.The results are a boost for both ahead of Wimbledon. Vukic has a place in the main draw while Duckworth will have to go through qualifying unless he gets a place as an alternate.

Video Transcript:
European shares tumble amid a global tech stock rout. Welcome to your Europe Markets Briefing. I am Elena Casas. The STOXX 600 is set for its worst day in over three months. The tech sector sank after a sell-off in US mega caps triggered by poor results from Tesla. Big European names also reported disappointing numbers. Stellantis and Renault both lost over 8% on the back of weak quarterly results, while luxury goods giant Kering fell 7.6% after a bigger-than-expected drop in second-quarter sales. Companies in the Eurozone's two biggest economies are growing more pessimistic, business surveys showed today. In Germany, the Ifo Business Climate Index fell for a fourth straight month. While in France, manufacturers said demand from abroad was weakening and morale in the services sector hit its worst level in more than three years. As President Macron welcomes business leaders to Paris ahead of tomorrow's Olympics, travel firms and airlines have been complaining that tourists are staying away. One strategist told us earlier that the latest economic projections for the Eurozone could turn out to be too optimistic.
Question marks about global growth will prove to be problematic for the Eurozone. So, we have seen those forward-looking survey indicators retreating quite significantly. Expectations within the Ifo survey dipped below the current reading, and that is a rather negative backdrop. So, I think that does suggest that the Euro macroeconomic projections are going to be challenged.
Well, after a fall in Lloyds' profits got UK bank earnings off to a weak start this morning, NatWest is up on Friday. The Conservative government was planning a major public share sale to reduce its 21% stake, but Labour has yet to announce its own plans. Stated pre-tax profits is expected to have dropped to GBP5.1 billion, down by nearly a sixth as interest income falls. Also, up tomorrow is Mercedes-Benz, after weak numbers from Stellantis, Ford, and Nissan today raised fears of a wider slowdown across the car industry. Also reporting are chemicals giant BASF and cement manufacturer Holcim. And flights were halted at Frankfurt Airport this morning after six climate change activists blocked runways by gluing themselves to the tarmac. The protestors were part of a Europe-wide wave of action that also disrupted airports in Switzerland and Norway this morning. While seven Just Stop Oil members were arrested at Heathrow.

Tech stocks fall heavily as investors sour on the mega caps. This is your US Morning Call. I'm Thomas Warner. Stock markets around the world were locked in a multitrillion-dollar tailspin on Thursday. Lackluster results from Tesla after the bell on Tuesday started an investor stampede out of the tech mega caps. The NASDAQ closed nearly 4% down yesterday, and the contagion spread to Asia and Europe overnight. More than $3 trillion has been wiped off world stocks in the last three days. Futures trading this morning suggests the equity markets may be starting to stabilize. Wall Street's major indexes look to be trading flat to lower this morning, but Tesla and NVIDIA both continued to lose ground premarket. One analyst that we spoke to says that Tesla now represents a golden opportunity.
I think it's going to be a very opportunistic buy here given this entry point in the confusion surrounding the stock. And you got to bet on Elon, especially with the potential Republican White House going forward, because he's very, very proactive and public about his relationship with the Republican leadership. And I think that will only serve to help his investments. And if he's helping his investments, you want to be on his side with your investments.
Meanwhile, markets are convinced that the Fed will have to cut rates in September. The CME FedWatch Tool now puts the chances of at least a 25-basis-point cut at more than 98%, up from 90% yesterday. The slump also prompted flight into safe haven assets like bonds and the Yen, which hit a two-and-a-half-month high relative to the Dollar overnight. Short-dated bonds got an extra boost from former New York Fed President William Dudley, who says the US central bank should cut rates next week rather than waiting until September. The market still sees the chance of that being just 11%. Turning to today now and Commerce Department data out at 8:30 Eastern is expected to show the economy grew an annualized 2% in the second quarter. That compares with 1.4% in the first quarter when consumers slowed spending in the face of higher rates. Separately, durable goods are expected to have gained 0.3% in June after rising 0.1% in May. And initial claims for state unemployment benefits likely fell back from 10-month highs during the week to July 20. It got a temporary lift the previous week because of Hurricane Beryl. The labor market is gradually cooling as the Federal Reserve's rate increases from 2022 and 2023 slow demand. Earnings season continues on Thursday, Southwest Airlines reported lower Q2 profits this morning, but the fall was lower than forecast, owing to successful cost cutting. American Airlines will also report on Thursday. Flight demand is at record levels this summer, but United Delta, Alaska, and Ryanair have all delivered downbeat outlooks. The sector is grappling with overcapacity as airlines thought demand would be even higher. Union Pacific is expected to report a second-quarter profit above estimates. Price hikes and a pick-up in vehicle shipments are seen offsetting a fall in demand from coal transporters. And that is your US Morning Call.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

Bill Gates was asked in an interview if he was ""disappointed"" with Tesla CEO for not discussing climate change. To this, he replied, ""He talks a lot. I hope he'll talk more about climate. You know, he's very, very smart. He's made a contribution within that area that is super important.""Bill Gates was also asked if there are some specific topics that he wants Elon Musk to touch on. He replied, ""I don't think he'll listen to anybody telling him what to talk about. He's unique, and he'll talk about whatever he feels like.""Both Bill Gates and Elon Musk have made comments against each other in public and often shared how they disagree on many topics. Earlier, Bill Gates questioned Elon Musk using his considerable fortune on getting humans to Mars. He would rather spend his own money funding vaccines to ""save lives"", Bill Gates said, adding that Elon Musk might become a great philanthropist one day.Bill Gates has also shared before how Elon Musk once acted ""super mean"" with him when he learned that the Microsoft founder shorted Tesla stock.""Once he heard I'd shorted the stock, he was super mean to me, but he's super mean to so many people, so you can't take it too personally,"" Bill Gates said, adding that he apologized to Elon Musk.

"BERLIN, July 21 (Bernama-dpa) -- The top official in the German state where Elon Musk built his Tesla gigafactory – the only one in Europe – has backed the company's controversial use of water resources in the region. ""We are well advised to use water sparingly. But Tesla is the wrong person to criticise for this,"" Brandenburg Premier Dietmar Woidke told German news agency (dpa). ""The company does not want to use any additional water in production and intends to fully recycle its industrial waste water in future,"" Woidke, who is a member of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democratic Party (SPD), said.Tesla opened its giant car plant in Grünheide, east of Berlin, more than two years ago. The move was considered a coup and netted the region, which was part of the former East Germany, around 12,000 jobs.Tesla wants to increase production and expand the site. Since its construction, there have been concerns from environmentalists and local residents, partly because the plant is located in a water protection area.But Woidke isn't worried.

(Photo: Business Wire)
Tesla has previously supplied Megapacks for Intersect Power’s Base Portfolio of solar + storage facilities totaling 2.4 GWh in operation or under construction. Intersect Power plans to utilize over half of this new order of Megapacks for four projects in California and Texas expected to achieve operations by the end of 2027, including what will be some of the largest battery installations in the country. The balance will be utilized in Intersect Power’s subsequent portfolio of solar + storage facilities, coming online in 2028-30.


“Intersect continues to be an exceptional partner, and their development expertise combined with the plug-and-play nature of Tesla’s vertically integrated technology enables the speed and scale needed to enhance grid resilience and support greater renewables integration,” said Mike Snyder, Senior Director of Tesla Energy.

Futures drop ahead of key jobs data. Hello and welcome to your US Morning Call. I am Ludovica Brignola. Stock futures are all in the red today after a strong session yesterday, as investors look ahead to JOLTS data due out later today. Economists polled by Reuters expect job opening to have declined to 7.91 million, down from 8.059 million in April. The data will be crucial in determining the state of a US labor market which remains resilient despite decades high interest rates. Traders have stuck to their bets of around two interest rate cuts from the Fed this year, according to LSEG. But an investor says he is less optimistic.
I think at this point in the economic cycle, inflation is somewhat sticky, demonstrated by still an elevated wage environment that is not consistent with the Fed's 2% inflation goal. Wages need to be somewhere between 3% and 3.5%. The latest update that we have seen for the month of May with the payroll report was that wages are about 4.2%.
Yields are slightly down as investors are looking ahead of jobs data on Friday as well. Non-farm payrolls are expected to have gone down to 190,000 in June from a reading of 272,000 in May. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is also expected to participate in a policy panel before the ECB Forum on Central Banking 2024 in Sintra, Portugal later today. Tesla's June quarter deliveries likely fell 6%, the first time the top EV-maker is set to post two straight quarters of decline amid stiff competition in China and slow demand due to a lack of affordable new models. Tesla has hit the brakes after years of rapid growth that helped make it the world's most valuable automaker. It warned in January that deliveries growth in 2024 would be notably lower as a boost from months-long price cuts is waning. The EV-maker is expected to announce the results on Tuesday ahead of the bell. Paramount Global is soaring in pre-market after billionaire Barry Diller's digital media conglomerate, IAC, is exploring a bid to take control of the media giant, a source told Reuters. ExxonMobil is scheduled to issue a preview of its first quarterly results to include results of its Pioneer Natural Resources acquisition. The filing provides margin and volume information on its energy businesses, and it is closely watched because it provides a preview of earnings and clues to how other oil and gas suppliers will fare. Staying with oil, prices are up around $0.5 per barrel at last check to reach fresh 2.5-month highs. They hit their highest since April yesterday on expectations of rising demand during the summer driving season. Possible supply disruption from Hurricane Beryl added to support for prices. And that is your US Morning Call.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

"Sirona Technologies, a Belgium-based Direct air capture (DAC) startup, has secured USD6.43 million in seed fundingFounded in 2023 in Brussels and led by a former Tesla engineer, Sirona Technologies is focused on speed, scalability, and low capex designs. Reversing climate change using DAC has gone from being a fringe idea that would never work to being a key part of any climate mitigation plan, and the first commercial plants are now operational. On top of phasing out fossil fuels to drastically reduce emissions, the role of DAC is to help remove 1 trillion tons of CO2 from the atmosphere. This is necessary to offset emissions that are too hard to avoid, and to clean up historical emissions. It uses machines that filter massive amounts of atmospheric air to remove the CO2, which is then injected and permanently stored in geological formations, where it turns into rock over two yearsSirona Technologies, a Belgium- based Direct air capture startup, has secured USD6.43 million in seed funding.

30km Awaruite Nickel Trend From Data Compilation at its Atlantic Nickel
Project in Central Newfoundland  - First Atlantic Nickel also announced it
has completed a large-scale data compilation for its 21,850-hectare
Atlantic Nickel Project in Central Newfoundland, Canada. This first-time
extensive review, covering the entire Pipestone Ophiolite Ultramafic
Complex, identified over 700 regional exploration reports. Of these, 134
contained relevant project information, including data on prospecting,
geological mapping, airborne geophysics, geochemistry, and drilling.

     The data compilation program outlined a 30-km core trend with
consistent, highly anomalous nickel concentrations, strongly correlating
with the Pipestone Complex's high-magnetic ultramafic rocks. These rocks
have high potential for hosting awaruite (nickel-iron alloy) nickel
deposits, positioning the project to become the first major awaruite nickel
exploration and development project in Atlantic Canada.   CONTINUED Read

     In additional developments this week, First Atlantic Nickel Identified
30km Awaruite Nickel Trend From Data Compilation at its Atlantic Nickel
Project in Central Newfoundland  - First Atlantic Nickel also announced it
has completed a large-scale data compilation for its 21,850-hectare
Atlantic Nickel Project in Central Newfoundland, Canada. This first-time
extensive review, covering the entire Pipestone Ophiolite Ultramafic
Complex, identified over 700 regional exploration reports. Of these, 134
contained relevant project information, including data on prospecting,
geological mapping, airborne geophysics, geochemistry, and drilling.

     The data compilation program outlined a 30-km core trend with
consistent, highly anomalous nickel concentrations, strongly correlating
with the Pipestone Complex's high-magnetic ultramafic rocks. These rocks
have high potential for hosting awaruite (nickel-iron alloy) nickel
deposits, positioning the project to become the first major awaruite nickel
exploration and development project in Atlantic Canada.   CONTINUED Read

"FIRST ATLANTIC NICKEL CORP (""FAN-V"")
FMC CORP (""FMC-N"")
TESLA INC (""TSLA-Q"")
UNITED STATES STEEL CORP (""X-N"")
POWER NICKEL INC (""PNPN-V"")
- Global Nickel Mining Market Expected to Reach $94 Billion By
- 2033 as Demand Surges

     FN Media Group News Commentary - The nickel mining market is fueling
several international industries that require nickel to continue to expand.
Experts see sustained growth in the global nickel mining market. A report
from Precedence Research said that the global nickel mining market size,
which surpassed USD 50.07 billion in 2023, is projected to be worth around
USD 94.43 billion by 2033, expanding at a CAGR of 6.60% from 2024 to 2033.
The report said: The surge in electric vehicle (EV) production and
renewable energy projects further propels the demand for nickel, a crucial
component in batteries and clean energy technologies. With expanding
economies, strategic investments in mining infrastructure, and a burgeoning
urbanization trend, Asia-Pacific remains a key player, driving substantial
growth and influencing the dynamics of the global nickel mining market. The
rapid expansion of the electric vehicle (EV) market stands as a pivotal
catalyst, driving a surge in nickel demand. Nickel's indispensable role in
electric vehicle batteries positions it as a cornerstone element in this
burgeoning market. It said key takeaways were: Asia-Pacific contributed
more than 58% of market share in 2023; North America is estimated to expand
the fastest CAGR between 2024 and 2033; By end-use, the non-ferrous alloys
segment has held the largest market share of 46% in 2023; By end-use, the
batteries segment is anticipated to grow at a remarkable CAGR of 7.8%
between 2024 and 2033; By mining technique, the open cast mining segment
generated over 56% of market share in 2023; and By mining technique, the
underground mining segment is expected to expand at the fastest CAGR over
the projected period.   Active companies in the markets this week include:
First Atlantic Nickel Corp. (OTCQB: FANCF) (TSXV: FAN), FMC Corporation
(NYSE: FMC), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), Power Nickel Inc. (OTCQB: PNPNF)
(TSX-V: PNPN), United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X).

     Precedence Research concluded: The Asia Pacific nickel mining market
size was valued at USD 29.04 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach
around USD 55.80 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 6.80% from 2024 to
2033. Asia-Pacific held a dominating share of 58% in the nickel mining
market due to a combination of factors. Asia-Pacific commands a significant
share in the nickel mining market due to robust industrialization,
infrastructure development, and the region's pivotal role in the global
stainless steel sector. North America is set for swift expansion in the
nickel mining market owing to a heightened need for nickel in electric
vehicle (EV) manufacturing and renewable energy applications. The region's
commitment to clean energy initiatives and carbon reduction fuels the
demand for nickel, essential in EV battery production. Supported by
favorable government policies, investments in sustainable mining methods,
and advancements in mining technologies, North America stands as a pivotal
player in the growing nickel mining sector on the global stage.

     In additional developments this week, First Atlantic Nickel Identified
30km Awaruite Nickel Trend From Data Compilation at its Atlantic Nickel
Project in Central Newfoundland  - First Atlantic Nickel also announced it
has completed a large-scale data compilation for its 21,850-hectare
Atlantic Nickel Project in Central Newfoundland, Canada. This first-time
extensive review, covering the entire Pipestone Ophiolite Ultramafic
Complex, identified over 700 regional exploration reports. Of these, 134
contained relevant project information, including data on prospecting,
geological mapping, airborne geophysics, geochemistry, and drilling.

     The data compilation program outlined a 30-km core trend with
consistent, highly anomalous nickel concentrations, strongly correlating
with the Pipestone Complex's high-magnetic ultramafic rocks. These rocks
have high potential for hosting awaruite (nickel-iron alloy) nickel
deposits, positioning the project to become the first major awaruite nickel
exploration and development project in Atlantic Canada.   CONTINUED Read

Description: Today's PPI and unemployment figures combine with yesterday's soft CPI reading to suggest the U.S. economy is cooling off.
Short Link: https://refini.tv/4b3rxIz
Video Transcript:
The US economy shows more signs of cooling. Welcome to Trading at Noon. I'm Thomas Warner. May's US Producer Price Index came in below forecast today. The PPI for final demand dropped 0.2% last month after advancing by an unrevised 0.5% in April. The number of Americans filing new unemployment claims, meanwhile, surprised to the upside. New claimant numbers jumped to 10-month highs of 242,000. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 225,000. Today's new numbers combined with yesterday's soft CPI reading to suggest that the economy is now cooling off. And that makes quicker interest rate cuts more likely, despite the Fed's own forecasts yesterday predicting only 25 basis points worth of cuts this year.
Things are setting up pretty nicely for them to go at least once this year. I suspect they will probably have a cause to go twice because, as I say, even though they will be conservative, they will want to see two or three more of these inflation reports come in quite benign. And we have seen the rise in the unemployment rate in the last non-farm payroll report, for our company, at least. You have seen some softness in some other labor market indicators. And so, under the mandates of their dual framework, looking at both employment and inflation, I suspect they will have enough evidence to get going, say, by the November meeting.
Treasury yields have slipped in response. The 10-year is down to its lowest since April at around 4.27%. The yield on the 30-year bond fell 0.6 basis points to 4.44%. The US Treasury Department will sell $22 billion in 30-year bonds on Thursday in its final auction of the week. The tale of two markets so far today, booming tech sector lifted the NASDAQ to a new record open. The Dow Jones, meanwhile, is down more than 0.5%. Its energy stocks have taken the biggest hit so far today. The wider S&amp;P is virtually flat. Broadcom is the NASDAQ's biggest gainer today, up more than 13%. The chipmaker raised its full-year revenue forecasts citing keen demand for AI-related hardware. It also plans to follow NVIDIA with its own 10-for-1 stock split. Broadcom shares are up 76% in the last 12 months. Tesla shares are up 6% ahead of today's shareholder meeting. Investors will vote on CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, as well as a corporate move to Texas. Musk has already said he believes he has the votes on both counts. The result will be announced at 5:30AM Eastern Time. Boeing shares are down after Reuters revealed that the planemaker is investigating another quality problem. Sources say that hundreds of fasteners have been incorrectly installed on the fuselages of some undelivered 787 Dreamliners. America's largest oil trade group today filed a federal lawsuit against new measures to reduce emissions. The Environmental Protection Agency issued rules in March that will force carmakers to produce more electric vehicles. The American Petroleum Institute, which includes ExxonMobil and Chevron, say that the EPA has exceeded its congressional authority. And that is Trading at Noon.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

"SHANGHAI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. carmaker Tesla broke ground on a mega factory in Shanghai on Thursday to manufacture its energy-storage batteries, Megapacks, a project hailed by the company as a ""milestone.""The latest move underscores Tesla's commitment to investing in the world's second-largest economy, defying the rhetoric of ""decoupling"" and ""de-risking"" from China ratcheted up by some U.S. politicians.The new plant spans an area of approximately 200,000 square meters, with a total investment of around 1.45 billion yuan (about 203.94 million U.S. dollars), according to the administration of Lin-gang Special Area of China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone.The mega factory is the first of its kind built by Tesla outside the United States and the company's second plant in Shanghai, following the inauguration of its gigafactory in 2019 which involved an initial investment of over 50 billion yuan.""I believe the new plant is a milestone for both Shanghai and Tesla,"" the company's vice president Tao Lin told Xinhua in an exclusive interview.""In a more open environment, we can create a new Tesla speed at the Megapack factory, and supply the global market with large-scale energy-storage batteries manufactured in China,"" she added.At Thursday's groundbreaking ceremony in Shanghai, Tesla representatives and local government officials formally launched the construction of the Megapack factory, which is expected to begin mass production in the first quarter of 2025, with an initial capacity of 10,000 Megapack units a year.""With Tesla's benchmark project, we anticipate that within the next three to five years, an industrial cluster centered around energy storage will rapidly emerge,"" said Lu Yu, an official of the Lin-gang Special Area Administration.After the ceremony, Tesla signed a deal with Shanghai Lingang Economic Development (Group) Co., Ltd., securing the first batch of orders for its Megapacks in China.Gong Wei, vice president of Lingang Group, said the Megapacks would be used for energy storage in a data center in the Lin-gang Special Area, as part of its efforts to achieve carbon peaking and carbon neutrality.Tesla's deep involvement in the energy storage industry now rivals its electric vehicles in importance, Tao said, adding that its energy storage products are currently used in over 60 countries and regions.The U.S. company already has a factory for its Megapacks in California, which has an annual capacity of 10,000 units.Each Megapack unit can store over 3.9 megawatt-hours of energy, sufficient to power approximately 3,600 households for one hour.As the global renewables powerhouse, China is a major market for energy storage. Last year, its installed renewable energy capacity surpassed thermal power for the first time, accounting for approximately 50 percent of the global additions to renewable energy capacity.Tesla's plan to open a Megapack battery plant in Shanghai was announced In April 2023, cementing another foothold for the company in China. The land acquisition deal for the project was signed in December of the same year, and it received a construction permit earlier this month.Lauding China's efforts in developing new energy industry, including the energy storage sector, Tao said the country boasts complete industrial chains, vast market potentials, and a production and business environment crucial for enterprise growth.In January 2019, Tesla broke ground on its Shanghai Gigafactory, becoming the first company to benefit from a policy allowing foreign carmakers to establish wholly-owned subsidiaries in the world's largest automotive market and one of the fastest-growing EV market.The gigafactory delivered 947,000 vehicles in 2023, an increase of 33 percent from the previous year. It has emerged as Tesla's primary vehicle export hub, with more than half of its global deliveries of over 1.8 million electric vehicles last year originating from there.Thursday's groundbreaking ceremony for the Megapack plant comes less than a month after Tesla CEO Elon Musk visited China, during which he said the company is willing to deepen cooperation with China to achieve more win-win results.China's faster-than-expected economic growth of 5.3 percent in the first quarter reaffirms its attractiveness for foreign investment. The number of newly established foreign-invested firms in the country hit 12,000 during the period, up 20.7 percent year on year.

"BERLIN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The municipality of Gruenheide near the German capital Berlin decided on Thursday, in a second attempt, to allow the expansion of the Tesla factory, despite ongoing protests.The first construction plan was rejected in February due to pressure from citizens. However, with a revised construction plan, the U.S. electric car maker is now allowed to build additional logistics capacities, including a freight station for trains, and around 50 hectares of forest, half the size of the original plans.The revised construction plan ""promotes municipal development, especially modern and sustainable infrastructure,"" said Joerg Steinbach, economics minister of the German state of Brandenburg, on social platform X on Thursday.Protests by climate activists, warning of the factory's potential impact on groundwater, threatened to escalate their demonstration. Local media reported several injuries in a clash between police and demonstrators attempting to storm the Tesla site last week. An arson attack on a nearby electricity pylon disrupted production for days at that time.Tesla aims to increase electric car production at its only gigafactory in Europe. However, with declining production figures, the company has already announced plans to cut jobs by 25 percent in Gruenheide, according to a report by German media Handelsblatt.

"Environmental protesters vowed to keep up the pressure on Tesla after failing to stop plans by Elon Musk's company from expanding its sprawling electric vehicle plant outside Berlin.The town council of Grünheide, guarded by police and plain-clothed security guards, gave the green light on Thursday to the US automaker after a heated, nearly three-hour debate disrupted by heckling and booing from the audience of about 200 people.A scaled-back ""compromise"" scheme, which still needs the go-ahead from local environmental authorities, allows Tesla to enlarge the manufacturing facility and build new infrastructure to move logistics to rail lines and off local roads.The company intends to double the capacity of the German site to 100 gigawatt hours of battery production and 1m EVs a year in the face of increasing Chinese competition in the European market.The Tesla manager, Alexander Riederer, told the meeting that long term, the company would like to see 2m cars roll off the Grünheide assembly line each year. The gigafactory, the first Tesla operation of its kind in Europe, employs about 12,500 workers.A week before the meeting, activists, who had set up a protest camp in the town where the factory is located, attempted to storm the Tesla premises during a rally of about 800 people, clashing with police. Musk, the Tesla CEO, criticised the response as too lenient on his social media platform X.The demonstrators, led by organisers Disrupt Tesla and supported by groups including Extinction Rebellion, argue that the enlarged site will cause damage to the local environment and threaten drinking water supplies.They also object to the impact on local communities in countries such as Argentina and Bolivia wreaked by lithium mining required to produce electric car batteries.Outside the gymnasium where the council meeting was held, about 50 activists held up banners reading ""Water is a human right"" and ""People over profit"".Participants had their bags inspected before entering the hall and security guards confiscated all water bottles.The final vote – 11 in favour, six opposed, two absentions – was met with cries of ""traitors!"" and ""we'll remember!"" and stunned silence among the demonstrators who later hugged and wept on the lawn in front of the building.Tesla welcomed the vote, saying it would provide ""reliability for planning"" while preventing 1,900 lorry trips each day on local roads thanks to the rail option.Esther Kamm, of the Turn Off the Tap on Tesla group, called the outcome a ""catastrophe"" and said protesters would not back down.""There are still many stages to come where we can cause disruptions and we will call on people to bring their pressure to bear,"" she said, suggesting civil disobedience as well as legal appeals.""The town can still withdraw its approval or Tesla can say 'we're sick of all this resistance, it's not worth it any more'.""However, many residents welcomed the coming expansion as good for the 9,000 people in Grünheide, about 25 miles (40km) south-east of central Berlin.""It frustrates me that the perspective you're hearing here is so local, so not-in-my-back yard,"" Bernd Rühl, 52, who works in the solar power sector.Rühl described himself as a former environmental activist and said he named his 20-year-old daughter after Julia 'Butterfly' Hill, who lived in an ancient California redwood tree for two years to keep it from being felled.He said he felt the protesters and local opponents failed to recognise the importance of the ""transport transformation"" away from Germany's dominant car industry built on combustion engines.""You can say what you want about Elon Musk – he's a polarising figure – but electric cars are the much better alternative if you care about global climate protection.""Robert Habeck, Germany's economy minister of the Greens, criticised the Grünheide protests last week, saying that automobile manufacturing would remain a crucial component of Europe's top economy for generations to come.""No one can have an interest in a Germany without car production,"" he told Funke media group. ""We are trying to get the cars of the future built here so that we can keep the jobs and value creation here. Tesla is building those kinds of cars.""Many of the protesters and residents said that the council's vote had been ""undemocratic"" because it ran counter to a non-binding referendum in February. Citizens voted by a 62% majority with a large turnout at that time against Tesla's plans.As a result, the company put forward a more modest scheme including cutting down 47 hectares of pine forest – half of what was originally planned.The protests, however, continued. The production site was shut down for a week in March after suspected arson cut off its power. A separate collective called Volcano group claimed responsibility for the fire, calling for the ""complete destruction of the gigafactory"".Copyright (c) 2024 theguardian.com-NonSyndicated",2024-05-17,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240517:nNRAsp13bn:16,Tesla,environment

The NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 500 rise on prospect of Big Tech results and the Fed. Welcome to your US Markets Briefing. I'm Ludovica Brignola. The S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ rose Monday as Wall Street gears up for another busy week of corporate earnings, while looking ahead to a key policy announcement from the US central bank. ON Semiconductor advanced 13.5% after reporting better-than-expected earnings and revenue, while Tesla rose more than 4.5% after Morgan Stanley named the electric vehicle stock a top pick. McDonald's shares are up and that's despite the company reporting earnings and revenues that missed estimates.
And the big surprise is actually the same-store sales comps was actually negative. That's the first time it's been negative since 2020. But we think it's kind of a compelling opportunity buying in here, stocks off 15%, trades at below 20X multiple. So, those long-term investors, we think it's an interesting data point to actually start buying McDonald's here.
Starbucks is expected to post a fall in third-quarter same-store sales as the coffee chain struggles with weak demand for its pricey lattes in its two biggest markets, the United States and China. Investors will watch out for comments on its plans for expansions in China. Microsoft is set to report Q4 earnings tomorrow. The company is expected to report a 15% rise in quarterly revenue amid robust demand for its AI-powered cloud and business software offerings. Analysts have said the CrowdStrike system breach, which caused a global IT outage, is unlikely to significantly impact Microsoft. Among a long list of earnings, Pfizer is expected to announce its second-quarter earnings on Tuesday before markets open. Performance of its COVID-19 vaccine and antiviral treatment Paxlovid will be the focus for investors. Treasury yields are lower in the US ahead of the JOLTS report tomorrow. Economists polled by Reuters expect the report to show 8 million job openings in June, down from 8.14 million in May, which was one of the lowest readings in three years. The July consumer confidence reading is also likely to ease to 99.7 from 100.4 in June. Investors are also looking ahead to the FOMC meeting on Wednesday and non-farm payrolls on Friday. The market wants to hear the Fed indicate a rate cut is coming as it is pricing in a near 90% probability of a 25 basis points cut in September. Oil prices fell by more than $1 a barrel on Monday after Israeli officials said they wanted to avoid dragging the Middle East into an all-out war, while responding to a deadly rocket strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights over the weekend.

Carmakers are catching up with economic reality. Both Nissan and Stellantis shares fell sharply last week after weak results, adding to gloom from rivals like Tesla. A tough market is eroding the high margins enjoyed by the European group and hindering its Japanese peer's turnaround. Any recovery could take time. Auto groups are facing multiple headwinds. After years of raising prices during the pandemic, they now have to contend with higher rates, weaker consumer demand, and a costly transition to electric powertrains. They must either cut prices or sell fewer cars. The average incentive per vehicle carmakers offer to sell products in the US rose to $3,129 last month, according to Autodata. Stellantis, the European group, shipped some 10% of fewer cars in the first half compared with the year earlier. Its operating profit fell sharply. The slump is a blot on Stellantis' stellar reputation for efficiency. Meanwhile, Nissan's 99% year-on-year drop in operating profit will undermine the fragile confidence in its turnaround. Nissan reckons there are better days just around the corner. The company is reducing production and launching fresh models later this year. Stellantis is still promising a double-digit margin this year, implying at least some stability. CEO Carlos Tavares is pledging to regain market share and cut costs. However, the headwinds are gathering speed. Nomura's forecasts that US industry inventories will rise to over 3 million vehicles by the year end. That implies renewed pressure on prices. And consumers appetite for new models may wane if central banks don't slash rates. The troubles are not yet in carmakers' rear view mirrors.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

"Kamala Harris's election campaign has accused Elon Musk of spreading ""manipulated lies"" after the Tesla chief executive posted a doctored video featuring the vice-president on his X account.Musk reposted a manipulated Harris campaign video on Friday evening in which a fake Harris voiceover says: ""I was selected because I am the ultimate diversity hire,"" and that anyone who criticises her is ""both sexist and racist"".The video has been viewed 128m times on Musk's account after the world's richest man posted it with the words ""this is amazing"" followed by a laughing emoji. Musk owns X, which he rebranded from Twitter last year.Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat senator, accused Musk of violating the platform's guidelines. According to X's synthetic and manipulated media policy, users are barred from sharing ""synthetic, manipulated, or out-of-context media that may deceive or confuse people and lead to harm"" although allowances are made for satire provided it does not ""cause significant confusion about the authenticity of the media"".A spokesperson for Harris's presidential campaign said: ""The American people want the real freedom, opportunity and security Vice-President Harris is offering; not the fake, manipulated lies of Elon Musk and Donald Trump.""The ""diversity hire"" attack line used by some Republicans has been criticised on both sides of the political fence, with the Republican former house speaker Kevin McCarthy calling the attacks ""stupid"" and the Democratic senator Raphael Warnock describing them as ""beneath the rhetoric the American people deserve at this time"".The fake Harris video was posted originally by the @MrReaganUSA account, which is linked to the conservative YouTuber podcaster Chris Kohls, on X and is labelled a parody.Kamala Harris Campaign Ad PARODY pic.twitter.com/5lBxvyTZ3o — Mr Reagan ???? (@MrReaganUSA) July 26, 2024However, Musk, who has endorsed Donald Trump's candidacy, did not flag the video as a parody when he posted it.The Democratic governor of California, Gavin Newsom, posted on X on Sunday evening that the manipulated Harris video should be ""illegal"" and that he would soon sign a bill banning such media, in apparent reference to a proposal supported by California lawmakers to ban ""materially deceptive"" election deepfakes.Musk responded on X that ""parody is legal in America"", including the original @MrReaganUSA video below it.Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which has been critical of X's content policies under its new owner, said Musk was signalling to his more than 190 million followers on X that ""this kind of AI-generated bile is welcome"". He added: ""Musk is not a fit or proper person to be in control of X Corp.""One deepfake expert said the Harris video showed the power of generative AI and deepfakes.""The AI-generated voice is very good,"" said Hany Farid, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. ""Even though most people won't believe it is VP Harris's voice, the video is that much more powerful when the words are in her voice, and I'm not sure that an AI-generated label would have had much impact on blunting this effect. This example shows the broad power of generative AI and deepfakes.""Farid added that given Harris's status as the presumptive Democrat nominee for the presidential election, he expected the US ""will be seeing more and more of this type of nonsense"".X has been contacted for comment.Copyright (c) 2024 theguardian.com-NonSyndicated",2024-07-29,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240729:nNRAtdt312:26,Tesla,social

Stock futures rise with a Fed verdict and Big Tech results expected this week. Hello, welcome to your US Morning Call. I'm Paul Barber. US index futures climbed this morning after the recent market routs as investors geared up for a busy week marked by a Federal Reserve interest rate decision, eagerly awaited tech earnings, and crucial labor data. NVIDIA, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla were up between 0.5% and 0.8% in pre-market trading. Investors will be closely watching a Federal Reserve policy meeting starting tomorrow. The monetary policy meeting should offer clues on whether officials are set to deliver interest rate cuts, which market participants widely expected to begin in September. Employment data at the end of the week, including the closely watched monthly jobs reports, could indicate if nascent downshift in the labor market has become more severe. Well, this week's results from Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook-parent company Meta could further test investors tolerance of potential earnings shortfalls from tech titans. The blistering rallies in the world's biggest tech companies this year pushed markets higher but have sparked concerns about stretched valuations. A months-long rally in Big Tech stocks hit a wall in the second half of July, culminating in a sell-off that saw the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ Composite Index notch their biggest one-day losses since 2022 last week. That after disappointing earnings from Tesla and Alphabet. This morning, McDonald's reported a surprise drop in quarterly global sales as cash-strapped customers opt for cheaper meals at home. The burger giant said sales fell 1% in the quarter, its first drop in more than three years. Meanwhile, Apple's upcoming artificial intelligence features will arrive later than anticipated and will miss the initial launch of upcoming iPhone and iPad software overhauls, that's according to a Bloomberg report. Abbott Laboratories dropped 7.6% after a jury ordered the healthcare company to pay $495 million in damages in a premature infant formula trial. The verdict in St. Louis, Missouri state court found formula milk made by Abbott caused a baby girl to develop a dangerous bowel disease. It comes in the first trial against the company out of hundreds of similar claims over the formula pending in courts around the country. Oil prices are stable as fears of a widening conflict in the Middle East after a rocket strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights put a floor under last week's price losses. And finally checking in on the election, Kamala Harris's campaign said on Sunday that it's raised $200 million and signed up 170,000 new volunteers in the week since she became the Democratic Party's presidential candidate. And that's your US Morning Call.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

"Jul 29, 2024Chicago, IL – July 29, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Alphabet GOOGL and Tesla TSLA.Alphabetreported earnings Tuesday and beat analysts’ estimates on both the top and bottom line, yet the stock is rolling over. Is it time to get out of the stock? I think not, and rather it would be a fantastic buying opportunity.For Immediate Release Time to Buy the Dip on Alphabet Following Earnings? There are two primary reasons for Alphabet's sell-off following its recent earnings report, both of which I believe are temporary. First, the overall market weakness is weighing on the stock. Second, there are concerns about whether the significant capital expenditures on AI infrastructure will generate sufficient near-term profits.While the concerns are reasonable, Alphabet is such a sturdy asset that I believe you can overlook any near-term concerns as the long-term still looks so fruitful for the company.But what is especially compelling is that GOOGL is trading at a relatively discounted valuation, while business fundamentals are strong, and the company enters exciting new technological ventures.For investors who are keen on buying leading technology stocks at a discount, Alphabet may be the next addition to your portfolio.Earnings Beat but the Alphabet Stock FallsAlphabet has reported a solid second quarter for 2024, showcasing strong performance across its key segments and continued innovation in artificial intelligence. The company's results underline its robust financial health and strategic investments in AI and cloud infrastructure.Alphabet delivered revenues of $85 billion, marking a 14% year-on-year increase. This growth was driven by strong performance in Search and Cloud services. The Cloud segment achieved quarterly revenues exceeding $10 billion for the first time, alongside a notable $1 billion in operating profit.Search revenues reached $48.5 billion, growing 13.8% year-over-year while Cloud revenues saw a slight acceleration, growing 28.8% to $10.4 billion. AI is playing a pivotal role here, with the majority of Alphabet's top 100 customers utilizing AI-driven services.Additionally, seeing a reacceleration of the core search business is a fantastic development as many investors had begun to doubt it.Furthermore, notes about the development at Waymo are very encouraging and have the potential to open another massive business opportunity for Alphabet.Huge Potential in Autonomous DrivingAlphabet announced that they would be committing another $5 billion to expansion at Waymo, and I think investors are still underestimating the incredible potential here.Waymo has made significant strides, delivering over 50,000 paid rides per week across San Francisco and Phoenix. But most importantly, Waymo has focused on optimizing its service for profitability and scalability, making strategic decisions that enhance its configurability across various vehicle types and conditions.This is a very different approach thanTeslais taking, as Alphabet believes providing the underlying technology will be a superior business model and is similar to the way GOOGL influences the mobile computing industry with Android. They make no devices but are the most widely used mobile software in the world.Waymo is also taking a bottom’s up approach, developing its own sensors to control the whole tech stack. Alternatively, Tesla relies solely on camera-based vision and must manage all the additional logistics of producing a full vehicle. The longer it takes Tesla to get full self-driving to actually work, the more I am favoring Waymo in leading the industry.Alphabet Stock Trading at a DiscountAs noted, Alphabet is trading at a valuation that I consider to be appealing for long-term investors. Today, GOOGL is trading at 22x forward earnings, which is below its 10-year median of 26.1x and below the market average.Because I believe Alphabet is among the best companies in the world, I think it unreasonable that it trades in line with the average of the index. With continued strong performance across business segments, and some incredible growth catalysts, I think Alphabet is compelling at current levels.Final ThoughtsDespite Alphabet's recent post-earnings dip, this may be an opportune moment for investors to buy the stock.Alphabet's second-quarter earnings report showed strong performance across key segments, with impressive growth in Search and Cloud services. The company continues to lead in AI-driven innovations, reinforcing its competitive edge. Additionally, the significant investment in Waymo highlights Alphabet's potential in the autonomous driving market, offering another promising growth avenue.At its current valuation, Alphabet presents an attractive opportunity for long-term investors. For investors seeking to capitalize on a leading technology stock at a discount, Alphabet is a compelling choice.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +7.0 average gain per year.

"Jul 29, 2024Chicago, IL – July 29, 2024 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Tesla TSLA, Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, Meta META and Microsoft MSFT.Market participants showed their disappointment with last Tuesday's results from two of ‘The Magnificent 7’ stocks: Google parentAlphabetandTesla.For Immediate ReleaseBreaking Down Magnificent 7 EarningsThe worrisome aspect of the market reaction to these two reports, particularly to the Alphabet release, is that this could be a precursor of what to expect this week from four other members of the group –Microsofton Tuesday, July 30th, after the market’s close (AMC),Meta Platformson Wednesday AMC, July 31standAppleon Thursday AMC, August 1st.It is hard to say anything positive about the Tesla report, but the Alphabet report had a lot of positives. Unlike Tesla, which missed consensus estimates on the back to continued margin pressures, Alphabet beat estimates and had a number of other positives in its results, including search and cloud.Investors instead zeroed in on the bigger-than-expected capital expenditure figure, which fed into creeping worries about ever-rising AI-centric capex without a timeline for when the spending will start to pay off. Alphabet management’s comment on the capex question that underinvesting represented a bigger risk than the alternative likely added to the market’s worries. A bigger jump in search growth that could be attributed to the company’s AI investments would have eased some of those worries, but that was not the case.The capex will likely be front and center in this week’s Meta and Microsoft reports as well. Concerning Amazon, a leader in the cloud space through its Amazon Web Services business, there are questions about the business’ decelerating growth trend in recent quarters when Microsoft and Alphabet are showing accelerating growth trends.Apple has started making some AI announcements lately, but many in the market appear skeptical of its efforts. The more significant near-term Apple questions are about the evolving iPhone trends in China.Returning to the Alphabet and Tesla results, Alphabet’s earnings were up +28.6% from the same period last year on +15% higher revenues. Tesla’s Q2 earnings were down -45.3% on +2.3% higher revenues.The group is expected to bring in +26.8% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +13.7% higher revenues.Beyond these Mag 7 players, total Q2 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +16.8% from the same period last year on +9.5% higher revenues.The Tech sector has enjoyed a favorable revisions trend for the last few quarters, with the Mag 7 stocks leading the rising estimates trend.Earnings Season Scorecard and This Week’s Earnings ReportsThrough all the results that came out on Friday, July 26th, we have seen Q2 results from 207 S&amp;P 500 members, or 41.4% of the index’s membership. Total earnings for these 207 index members are up +0.6% from the same period last year on +4.9% higher revenues, with 79.7% beating EPS estimates and only 57.5% able to beat revenue estimates.The Q2 reporting cycle really ramps up this week, with more than 1000 companies on deck to report results, including 170 S&amp;P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 stocks, this week’s line-up includes a representative cross-section of reports from different sectors, including bellwethers like McDonald’s, Procter &amp; Gamble, Pfizer, Starbucks, Mastercard, Boeing, DuPont, Exxon, Chevron, and others.The one notable feature of the above comparison charts is the very low level of Q2 revenue beats percentage. In fact, the Q2 revenue beats percentage of 57.5% is a new low for this group of 207 index members over the preceding 20-quarter period (5 years).The Earnings Big PictureLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out already with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&amp;P 500 earnings are expected to be up +6.9% from the same period last year on +5.2% higher revenues.As we have been flagging all along in this space, we experienced a notably favorable revisions trend ahead of the start of the Q2 earnings season, with estimates for Q2 holding up far better than other recent periods. In the three-month period from the start of the quarter through June 30th, Q2 estimates for the S&amp;P 500 index fell the least relative to the comparable periods of other recent quarters.Looking at earnings expectations on an annual basis, total 2024 S&amp;P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.7% on +1.7% revenue growth.The expected revenue growth pace improves to +4% once Finance is excluded from the aggregate data, with the index level aggregate earnings growth for the year declining only to +8.4% on an ex-Finance basis.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Will Mag 7 Earnings Meet Expectations?Zacks Investment Research is under common control with affiliated entities (including a broker-dealer and an investment adviser), which may engage in transactions involving the foregoing securities for the clients of such affiliates.Media ContactZacks Investment Research800-767-3771 ext. 9339support@zacks.comhttps://www.zacks.comZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

"The Allan Labor Government?s $480 million investment into Victoria?s energy grid has reached another milestone with the delivery of 100 Tesla Megapacks to the Koorangie Energy Storage System. The battery system will help accelerate the transition to renewables and help lower power bills.Minister for Energy and Resources Lily D?Ambrosio was at the facility west of Kerang to welcome the delivery of the large-scale rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, which will provide critical energy storage and boost the amount of renewables that can be hosted in the Murray River region by up to 300 megawatts.The Koorangie Energy Storage System is one of 12 projects being delivered as part of the Government?s $480 million Renewable Energy Zone Fund, which is strengthening and modernising the state?s grid so more affordable and reliable renewable energy can flow to homes, businesses, hospitals and schools across the state.The project will use cutting-edge grid forming inverters to enable the battery to play a dual role in providing both storage for the abundant renewable energy in north-west Victoria and strengthening the grid to enable even more renewables to connect.The 100 Telsa Megapacks will total 185 megawatts of storage capacity. Once completed in 2025, a single charge of the battery system will be able to power all the homes in the Gannawarra Shire Council area for more than 14 days or all the homes in Kerang for more than 30 days.In addition, the grid forming inverters will allow the battery to replace the type of system strength services that were once only provided by fossil-fuel generators. This game-changing technology is a significant advancement in the transition to renewables as it further reduces the reliance on ageing coal-fired generators.Copyright (c) 2024 Euclid Infotech Pvt Ltd.",2024-07-27,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240727:nNRAtdbtaf:1,Tesla,social

Description: Although all three of Wall Street's main indexes closed higher, only the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended in positive territory for the week. Lisa Bernhard has more.
Short Link: https://refini.tv/4cX3hcN
Video Transcript:
Wall Street's major indexes ended higher on Friday, as investors flocked back to Big Tech stocks that had triggered broad sell offs earlier in the week. The Dow climbed more than 1.6%, and the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ both closed just above 1%. Five members of the so-called Magnificent Seven rose on Friday, led by Meta Platforms, which climbed more than 2.5%. The two exceptions were Tesla and Alphabet, whose lackluster earnings had triggered Wednesday's big market sell-off. With further Magnificent Seven earnings due next week, the immediate outlook for markets may hinge on what type of results these companies deliver. Anna Rathbun is Chief Investment officer at CBIZ Investment Advisory Services.
I think what's behind there is this expectation from the investors saying, okay, we've given you AI-related hype for now over a year. We want to start seeing some quantitative metrics on the ROI of these billions of dollars you're putting into AI, and Alphabet didn't deliver that, right? So for next week we have other stocks and other companies that are investing in AI. If investors have the same expectations, we may be looking at a similar type of disappointment if they don't deliver any quantitative metrics.
Among other stock movers, Deckers Outdoor jumped more than 6% after it raised its annual profit forecast. Norfolk Southern soared nearly 11%, its largest one-day percentage gain since March 2020, after the rail operator reported second-quarter profit above Wall Street estimates thanks to robust pricing. And medical device maker Dexcom slumped more than 40% after cutting its annual revenue forecast. Data on Friday showed a moderate rise in US prices, which underlined cooling inflation. Investors will now look to the Federal Reserve for possible signals of a September rate cut when the central bank holds its latest two-day policy meeting next week.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

Description: From how tech stocks sparked a big tumble on Wall Street, to a software update that did not go as planned, we round up the big stories in business and finance over the week to July 26. Alice Rizzo reports.
Short Link: https://refini.tv/3SqJWZ5
Video Transcript:
From a reversal of fortune for mega cap stocks, to an IT update gone very wrong, this is The Week in Numbers. Over $3 trillion was the value wiped off world equity markets by Thursday. Tech stocks led the tumble, after lackluster earnings from firms including Google-owner Alphabet. The rout comes after enthusiasm over AI had driven US stocks to record highs. 12% was the slide for Tesla shares after the EV maker missed earnings forecasts and reported its lowest profit margin for five years. Boss Elon Muskâs enthusiasm for products besides cars also has some investors scratching their heads. Prime Capital investment strategist Will McGough.
Tesla is a very confusing stock, in my opinion. They're confusing the street with what they actually are, are they an electric vehicle company, or are they going to be with battery storage? Is it going to be a robotics? Is it going to be AI, or could it be a sum of all the above?
Over 6,000 was the number of flights cancelled by Delta after an IT meltdown. A faulty software update from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike sparked chaos at companies worldwide, with airlines among the hardest hit. 2.8% was how fast the US economy grew over the latest quarter. That was double the rate in the previous three months. Consumer spending and business investment helped drive the gains, as inflation pressures eased. And 99% was the plunge in first-quarter earnings at Nissan. The Japanese automaker saw profits almost wiped out as it was forced to do big discounts in the US. Nissan is vowing to bounce back in the coming months with the launch of new models.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

Description: Mercedes-Benz lowered its annual profit margin forecast after weak second quarter sales and earnings on Friday (July 26), capping a week that saw disappointing numbers from big names including Nissan, Ford and Tesla. Julian Satterthwaite reports.
Short Link: https://refini.tv/4cRBB94
Video Transcript:
Mercedes-Benz has capped a tough week for big automakers. The German giant on Friday cut profit forecasts, after weak sales and earnings in the second quarter. Like rivals, it's battling headwinds including lackluster demand for EVs and mounting competition in China. Supply bottlenecks and high interest rates also remain a drag. Mercedes reported a 6% drop in sales for the first half, and a 17% plunge in sales of electric cars. The company said it now had a cautious view on China, where it expects fierce competition, particularly for its cheaper products. It was more hopeful about prospects in Europe, and said it saw solid momentum in the US. Mercedes shares fell as much as 1.4% in early European trade following the news, but later recovered to trade flat. The wary outlook added to a tough week for the industry. Earlier, Japan's Nissan reported a 99% plunge in its first-quarter profit, after it was forced to do big discounts in the US. Ford shares tumbled 13% after it missed forecasts, citing quality-related problems and competition in the EV market. And Tesla stock sank too, after it also missed forecasts and saw profit margins sink to a five-year low.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

"New DelhiNew Delhi, July 26 -- Days after Elon Musk said his trans-daughter is ""dead"" to him, Vivian Jenna Wilson, in her first interview on Thursday, said the Tesla chief was a ""cruel"" and absent father.Sharing that she received a hard time from her father as a child for being ""queer"" and ""feminine"", Vivian, in an interview with NBC News, denied Musk's claim of being ""tricked into authorizing trans-related medical treatment for her when she was 16.Vivian said Musk, after initial hesitation, knew what she was doing when he agreed to her treatment. The trans-related medical treatment requires consent from parents.On Monday, Elon Musk said on social media and in an interview posted online that Vivian was ""not a girl"" and was figuratively ""dead"", ""killed by the woke mind virus"".In a post on X (formerly), Musk used Vivan's dead name and said: ""Xavier was born gay and slightly autistic , two attributes that contribute to gender dysphoria. I knew that from when he was about 4 years old and he would pick out clothes for me to wear like a jacket and tell me it was ""fabulous!"", as well as his love of musicals &amp; theatre. But he was not a girl.""The 20-year-old told NBC News that Musk's recent statements crossed a line, likely because he assumed Vivian wouldn't say anything and let it go unchallenged.She said, ""Which I'm not going to do, because if you're going to lie about me, like, blatantly to an audience of millions, I'm not just gonna let that slide.""In a telephonic interview with NBC News, Vivian said Musk hasn't been a supportive father and was rarely present in her life. Musk berated her when he was present, she added.Vivian and her twin brother were born to Musk's first wife, author Justine Musk. The couple divorced in 2008, and she said her parents shared custody between their homes in the Los Angeles area.She shared that she and her siblings were cared for by their mother or nannies, even though Musk had joint custody.""He was cold. He's very quick to anger. He is uncaring and narcissistic,"" she said.When she was a child, Vivian said, Musk would harass her for exhibiting feminine traits and pressurise her to appear more masculine, including by pushing her to deepen her voice as early as elementary school.""I was in fourth grade. We went on this road trip that I didn't know was actually just an advertisement for one of the cars - I don't remember which one - and he was constantly yelling at me viciously because my voice was too high,"" she said. ""It was cruel.""Sharing that she hadn't spoken to Musk in about four years, Vivian saidshe refuses to be defined by him. ""I would like to emphasize one thing: I am an adult. I am 20 years old. I am not a child."" ""My life should be defined by my own choices."" Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MINT.

Description: Asian shares were hammered on Thursday as a slump in global tech stocks sent investors fleeing into less risky assets, including short-dated bonds, the yen and Swiss franc. Julian Satterthwaite reports.

Video Transcript:
Asian stocks took a hit Thursday amid jitters over the outlook for Big Tech. Japan was worst hit, with the Nikkei index down around 2.5% in morning trade. Chipmaker Renesas plunged as much as 16%, with Hitachi among other big decliners. The rest of the region wasnât spared, with benchmark indexes in South Korea and Hong Kong both off 1.5% or more. It all followed big falls on Wall Street earlier. The NASDAQ index shed almost 4% after lackluster earnings from Alphabet and Tesla. That marked its worst one-day fall since 2022. Prime Capital Strategist Will McGough says US politics is also a looming issue for global markets.
We obviously have the election coming up, which is going to induce a lot of volatility, although it's not going to have immediate impact on the markets. The markets are going to be trying to figure out what the impact of future policies out of D.C. will have on today. But we can't figure that out until we get more clarity around what Washington D.C. is going to look like.
One analyst said worries over Chinaâs growth prospects played into the falls in Asia. A surprise move Thursday by the countryâs central bank to cut long-term borrowing costs did nothing to lift the mood. Even strong earnings werenât enough to spare equities. South Korean chipmaker, SK Hynix, reported its best quarter in six years, boosted by AI demand. But its shares still plunged around 8%. Instead, money flowed into some assets traditionally seen as safe havens, with the Japanese Yen up more than 1% overnight.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

Description: The Dow Jones Industrial Average hung onto early gains to close higher on stronger-than-expected U.S. gross domestic product data. Lisa Bernhard has more.

Video Transcript:
The S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ ended a bumpy session weaker on Thursday, failing to regain ground lost in the previous day's tech-triggered sell-off. The Dow added 0.20%, the S&amp;P lost 0.50%, and the NASDAQ fell more than 0.90%. All three indexes were up for most of the session on the heels of stronger-than-expected second quarter GDP data. Mega-cap stocks traded higher mid-afternoon, only to fall later in the day, with Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and NVIDIA all ending lower. Lackluster earnings from both Tesla and Alphabet had pummeled Magnificent Seven stocks a day earlier, causing the S&amp;P and NASDAQ to log their worst day since 2022. Alphabet's shares dipped again on Thursday, falling 3% to the stock's lowest close since May 6. But Tesla rebounded 2%. Four more mega-cap tech companies report earnings next week. But while Brad Bernstein, Managing Director at UBS Private Wealth Management, called their results ""critical"", it's the rest of the market he's excited about.
So, we actually think the big story in earnings season this month will be the fact that for the first time in two years, we're going to have earnings growth in the non-Magnificent Seven of the S&amp;P 500. So, the 493 other stocks that have had no earnings growth as collectively over the last several years are finally going to have earnings growth. And we think that bodes very well for the rally to continue because earnings are now growing from other areas within the market.
Among earnings-driven moves, IBM shares jumped more than 4% after the tech company beat estimates for second quarter revenue and raised the annual growth forecast for its software business. Shares of American Airlines rose more than 4% after the company said it had taken swift action to reset its sales and distribution strategy which had driven away corporate travelers. Meanwhile, shares of Southwest Airlines climbed 5.5% after saying it would end open seating on its flights. On the flip side, Ford shares plummeted more than 18% after the automaker's second quarter adjusted profit missed estimates by a wide margin.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

Description: This week on The Last Word, Paul and Chris dissected a tumultuous week in the markets.

Meanwhile, the energy sector witnessed increased merger and acquisition activity. In terms of economic indicators, the US showed signs of potential interest rate cuts, while Australia grappled with persistent inflation challenges.

The Allan Labor Governments 480 million investment into Victorias energy grid has reached another milestone with the delivery of 100 Tesla Megapacks to the Koorangie Energy Storage System The battery system will help accelerate the transition to renewables and help lower power bills Minister for Energy and Resources Lily DAmbrosio was at the facility west of Kerang to welcome the delivery of the largescale rechargeable lithiumion batteries which will provide critical energy storage and boost the amount of renewables that can be hosted in the Murray River region by up to 300 megawatts.The Koorangie Energy Storage System is one of 12 projects being delivered as part of the Governments 480 million Renewable Energy Zone Fund which is strengthening and modernising the states grid so more affordable and reliable renewable energy can flow to homes businesses hospitals and schools across the state.The project will use cutting edge grid forming inverters to enable the battery to play a dual role in providing both storage for the abundant renewable energy in northwest Victoria and strengthening the grid to enable even more renewables to connect. The 100 Telsa Megapacks will total 185 megawatts of storage capacity Once completed in 2025 a single charge of the battery system will be able to power all the homes in the Gannawarra Shire Council area for more than 14 days or all the homes in Kerang for more than 30 days. In addition the grid forming inverters will allow the battery to replace the type of system strength services that were once only provided by fossilfuel generators.This gamechanging technology is a significant advancement in the transition to renewables as it further reduces the reliance on ageing coalfired generators. The project was identified by VicGrid and the Australian Energy Market Operator AEMO as a priority for development and is being delivered by Edify Energy and infrastructure investor Sosteneo on behalf of the Government and AEMO. The Government has legislated ambitious storage targets of at least 26 gigawatts GW by 2030 and at least 63 GW by 2035 enough renewable energy to power around half of Victorias current homes at their peak energy use For more information visit Quotesattributable to Minister for Energy and Resources Lily DAmbrosioKoorangie is a cutting edge facility that will help Victoria hit our energy storage targets and support our transition to renewable energy by providing stability to our energy grid regional Victoria Projects like Koorangie are keeping the lights on for households across the state and are helping us move away from expensive fossil fuels and onto safer affordable and more reliable renewable energyQuotes attributable to member for Northern Victoria Jaclyn Symes.

"Add bluefish falling out of the sky to the list of perils living at the Jersey Shore.Cynthia and Jeff Levine had no idea what smashed the windshield of their 2023 Tesla Y in their driveway on Sunday afternoon. Cynthia said the car alarm started beeping and when they went to investigate, they saw their windshield was shattered in a bullseye pattern.Their only clues were traces of blood and fish scales, but no fish in sight − at first. But then the sleuthing began.""We were baffled. We looked at the garage camera and there was nothing. Then we went to the Tesla's dashcam and saw the fish fall out of the sky, bounce off the windshield and land in the garage,"" said Cynthia Levine.Watch as fish flies into Tesla windshield1 lb. bluefish found on garage floorSure, enough, the Levine's found a one-pound bluefish on the garage floor, which had been open that the time. Levine said the most logical explanation is a bird fished it out of the water and dropped it by mistake. Bluefish are a very common gamefish to the Jersey Shore that easily grow to 10 or more pounds.She said the fish had what looked like talon marks in its flesh and the culprit might be an eagle that nests near their home. Other birds of prey such as ospreys are often seen at the Shore carrying fish from the bay or ocean to their nests.The next step for the Levines is proving to the insurance company that a bluefish hit their car. They had the car towed Monday morning for the repair. Working in their favor is the fact that it's not the first time a fish falling from the sky has caused havoc.Last August, JCP&amp;L said a fish caused a power outage when it hit a transformer and caused it to explode in Sayreville, about 20 miles east-northeast of Atlantic Highlands. Police even drew a sketch of a bird, their lead suspect, in a tongue-in-cheek news release.When Jersey Shore native Dan Radel is not reporting the news, you can find him in a college classroom where he is a history professor.

"Jul 25, 2024Chicago, IL – July 25, 2024– Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says, ""Looking at Q2 as a whole, total earnings for the S&amp;P 500 are expected to be up +9.6% from the same period last year on +4.9% higher revenues. This will be the highest earnings growth pace since the +10% earnings growth in the first quarter of 2022.""Note: The following is an excerpt from this week's Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here&gt;&gt;&gt;For Immediate ReleaseWill Mag 7 Earnings Meet Expectations?Here are the key points:For the 134 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported Q2 results, or 26.8% of the index's total membership, total earnings are up +7.6% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues, with 81.3% beating EPS estimates and 57.5% beating revenue estimates.Except for the revenue beats percentage, which at 57.5% is the lowest for this group of 134 index members over the preceding 20-quarter period, all of the other performance metrics are tracking better relative to what we have seen in other recent periods.Looking at Q2 as a whole, total earnings for the index are expected to be up +9.6% from the same period last year on +4.9% higher revenues. This will be the highest earnings growth pace since the +10% earnings growth in the first quarter of 2022.Q2 earnings for the 'Magnificent 7' companies are expected to be up +26.6% from the same period last year on +13.6% higher revenues. Excluding the 'Mag 7', Q2 earnings growth for the rest of the index drops to +6.1% (from +9.6%).AlphabetGOOGL and Tesla TSLA kicked off the Q2 reporting cycle for the 'Magnificent 7' stocks, with the market unimpressed with either of the two reports. This contrasted with the companies' Q1 releases when both Alphabet and Tesla were up big on the quarterly results.There is no surprise in the Tesla sell-off, as the company not only missed estimates but also had nothing good to say about the near-term outlook. The EV maker has been suffering competitive challenges in its core market, prompting it to cut prices that are weighing on its margins. As a result, Tesla's Q2 earnings were down -45.3% on +2.3% higher revenues. Given Tesla shares' gain of more than +40% in the three-month period ahead of the quarterly release, the post-release sell-off makes perfect sense.The sell-off in Alphabet shares is far harder to understand, as the search giant handily beat estimates and showed broadly positive trends in all of its businesses.The issue in the Alphabet report appears to be the market's disappointment with a bigger-than-expected capital spending level in the period of $13.2 billion relative to expectations of $12.2 billion. Management also indicated that they saw underspending as a bigger risk at this stage of the AI rollout than the alternative, which was interpreted as indicative of an elevated capex spend trend than what investors had been factoring in.We don't see elevated capex by Alphabet or any other Tech operator as a negative, but this appears to be the case with Tech investors at this stage. Perhaps the market would like to see a tangible path toward monetization for all the AI-centric investments in which Alphabet and its peers are currently engaged in. This also means that capex spending levels in the coming Meta and Microsoft reports will similarly receive close scrutiny.For the Mag 7 group as a whole, Q2 earnings are expected to be up +26.6% on +13.6% higher revenues.Beyond the Mag 7, Q2 earnings for the Tech sector as a whole are expected to be up +16.3% from the same period last year. The revisions trend for the Tech sector has been positive for a while now, which is important since the sector alone is on track to bring in almost 30% of all S&amp;P 500 earnings over the coming four-quarter period.For full-year 2024, Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +17.2%, followed by another strong showing expected next year.A big contributing factor to the Tech sector's positive earnings outlook is the sector's margins outlook.We are already in record territory with Tech sector margins, with 2024 margins expected to exceed last year's record level. The expectation is for some more gains next year and the year after, with the ever-growing share of higher-margin software and services in the overall Tech earnings pie explaining the favorable trend. Part of this likely also reflects optimism about the impact of AI on the sector's productivity.The Earnings Big PicturePlease note that this year's +8.7% earnings growth on only +1.7% top-line gains reflects revenue weakness in the Finance sector. Excluding the Finance sector, the earnings growth pace changes to +8.5%, and the revenue growth rate improves to +3.9%. In other words, about half of this year's earnings growth comes from revenue growth, with margin gains accounting for the rest.On the margins front, 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to have higher margins in 2024 relative to last year, with Tech, Finance, and Consumer Discretionary as the big gainers.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +7.0 average gain per year.

Description: Data showed the US economy grew faster than expected in the second quarter, lending some support to market sentiment after Wednesday's sharp selloff for tech stocks.

Video Transcript:
US second-quarter GDP surprises to the upside. Welcome to Trading at Noon. I am Thomas Warner. Data showed the US economy grew faster than expected in the second quarter. Annualized growth of 2.8% came in well above estimates of 2.0%. But inflation, as measured by the Core PCE Price Index, subsided, leaving expectations of a September rate cut intact. Separate report showed weekly jobless claims fell more than expected as distortions from the weather and temporary automobile plant closures faded. Turning to the equity markets now, and the main US indexes opening mixed, with the S&amp;P and NASDAQ dipping in and out of positive territory. This after the NASDAQ suffered its worst day since 2022 on Wednesday. Investors assessed stronger-than-expected GDP data but remained cautious after suffering that tech mauling in the previous session. US Treasury yields, meanwhile, fell for a third day on Thursday as investors piled into shorter-dated bonds in anticipation of rate cuts. The global sell-off in tech stocks and other risk assets also fanned the push into safe haven assets. The gap between 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields hits its narrowest since October 2023 and was just a whisker below where it was in July 2022. In outright terms, NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Apple were among this morning's heaviest fallers on the S&amp;P 500. NVIDIA is down nearly 16% from its all-time high back in June. Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon all also traded lower. But Tesla bucked the trend, up 3% after its worst day in nearly four years yesterday. One analyst that we spoke to said that traders are reassessing the entire sector.
I think there is some caution. Obviously, Alphabet did beat expectations but not by enough to create upward momentum in the stock. And Tesla had a pretty broad-based miss. But ultimately, I think there is a questioning of traders of how much more money is going to be needed to invest in AI and when is that pay-off ultimately going to play out.
Outside of the mega caps, Ford Motors was down more than 17% at last check, after its second-quarter profit missed analyst expectations overnight. The automaker has been weighed down by its underperforming electric vehicle business. IBM shares moved the other way, gaining after the IT giant raised the forecast for its software business. It sees clients continuing to spend more on AI. US aerospace and defense company RTX, formally known Raytheon, raised its full-year earnings forecast and beat estimates for second-quarter profit. It has been boosted by the rebound in commercial aviation. Its stock was up 8% to an all-time high. Warner Bros. Discovery shares fell, meanwhile, on news that the company's networks have lost the rights to the NBA, ending a 40-year relationship. Walt Disney's ESPN, Comcast-owned NBCUniversal, and Amazon.com have clinched the rights instead. And that is Trading at Noon.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

Description: A global rout in tech stocks sent European markets down across the board, while quarterly results from Stellantis, Renault and Kering also disappointed. On Friday's calendar are Mercedes-Benz, BASF and NatWest.

Video Transcript:
European shares tumble amid a global tech stock rout. Welcome to your Europe Markets Briefing. I am Elena Casas. The STOXX 600 is set for its worst day in over three months. The tech sector sank after a sell-off in US mega caps triggered by poor results from Tesla. Big European names also reported disappointing numbers. Stellantis and Renault both lost over 8% on the back of weak quarterly results, while luxury goods giant Kering fell 7.6% after a bigger-than-expected drop in second-quarter sales. Companies in the Eurozone's two biggest economies are growing more pessimistic, business surveys showed today. In Germany, the Ifo Business Climate Index fell for a fourth straight month. While in France, manufacturers said demand from abroad was weakening and morale in the services sector hit its worst level in more than three years. As President Macron welcomes business leaders to Paris ahead of tomorrow's Olympics, travel firms and airlines have been complaining that tourists are staying away. One strategist told us earlier that the latest economic projections for the Eurozone could turn out to be too optimistic.
Question marks about global growth will prove to be problematic for the Eurozone. So, we have seen those forward-looking survey indicators retreating quite significantly. Expectations within the Ifo survey dipped below the current reading, and that is a rather negative backdrop. So, I think that does suggest that the Euro macroeconomic projections are going to be challenged.
Well, after a fall in Lloyds' profits got UK bank earnings off to a weak start this morning, NatWest is up on Friday. The Conservative government was planning a major public share sale to reduce its 21% stake, but Labour has yet to announce its own plans. Stated pre-tax profits is expected to have dropped to GBP5.1 billion, down by nearly a sixth as interest income falls. Also, up tomorrow is Mercedes-Benz, after weak numbers from Stellantis, Ford, and Nissan today raised fears of a wider slowdown across the car industry. Also reporting are chemicals giant BASF and cement manufacturer Holcim. And flights were halted at Frankfurt Airport this morning after six climate change activists blocked runways by gluing themselves to the tarmac. The protestors were part of a Europe-wide wave of action that also disrupted airports in Switzerland and Norway this morning. While seven Just Stop Oil members were arrested at Heathrow. And that is your Europe Markets Briefing.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

"An online forum dedicated to mocking the Tesla Cybertruck has attracted more than 110,000 members following four recalls of the electric truck.The r/CyberStuck channel on Reddit is now among the top 2 per cent of sub-Reddits on the site, less than a year after the controversial truck hit the market.Tesla has not revealed how many Cybertrucks have been shipped to customers, but the most recent recall in April suggests it was less than 4,000 between November 2023 and April 2024 – just 3.5 per cent of the number of r/CyberStuck members.Describing itself as ""the place to post images of Cybercucks stuck in their Cybertrucks"", the community encourages members to share images and videos of Tesla's newest vehicle breaking down or failing to cope with off-road situations.""No defending this hideous piece of road garbage,"" the forum's rules state. ""The sub is about how awful it is. Go post on a Tesla sub if you want to defend it.""The most popular post on the sub-Reddit, which has been upvoted more than 34,000 times, shows a ""humiliated"" Cybertruck owner attempting to put up an awning at a campsite.""I am convinced that this vehicle was designed by people who have no truck experience, for people who have never owned a truck, so they can do 'truck things' they read about on the internet,"" the top comment reads.Other posters criticise the boxy design of the ""low polygon truck"", while others claim it is unable to perform tasks to the same level as other off-road vehicles, such as driving on sand or ice.Created in December 2023, 56-year-old founder Alex Beattie said he did not intend for it to be an attack on electric vehicles, Tesla, or even its CEO Elon Musk.""It's not some gut-level push to get everybody to hate the Cybertruck,"" Mr Beattie told SFGate. ""It's just general lighthearted mockery. It's not that there's any great agenda behind it other than, 'Haha, look what's happened now!'""The Cybertruck has faced several issues in the eight months since its launch, despite Mr Musk's claims that the stainless steel truck would be ""apocalypse-proof"".Following two years of delays, the vehicle has faced recalls for a faulty windscreen wiper and an accelerator pedal that could come loose and get stuck in the interior trim.Copyright © 2024 independent.co.uk",2024-07-25,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240725:nNRAtcqvmg:1,Tesla,social

Tech stocks fall heavily as investors sour on the mega caps. This is your US Morning Call. I'm Thomas Warner. Stock markets around the world were locked in a multitrillion-dollar tailspin on Thursday. Lackluster results from Tesla after the bell on Tuesday started an investor stampede out of the tech mega caps. The NASDAQ closed nearly 4% down yesterday, and the contagion spread to Asia and Europe overnight. More than $3 trillion has been wiped off world stocks in the last three days. Futures trading this morning suggests the equity markets may be starting to stabilize. Wall Street's major indexes look to be trading flat to lower this morning, but Tesla and NVIDIA both continued to lose ground premarket. One analyst that we spoke to says that Tesla now represents a golden opportunity.
I think it's going to be a very opportunistic buy here given this entry point in the confusion surrounding the stock. And you got to bet on Elon, especially with the potential Republican White House going forward, because he's very, very proactive and public about his relationship with the Republican leadership. And I think that will only serve to help his investments. And if he's helping his investments, you want to be on his side with your investments.
Meanwhile, markets are convinced that the Fed will have to cut rates in September. The CME FedWatch Tool now puts the chances of at least a 25-basis-point cut at more than 98%, up from 90% yesterday. The slump also prompted flight into safe haven assets like bonds and the Yen, which hit a two-and-a-half-month high relative to the Dollar overnight. Short-dated bonds got an extra boost from former New York Fed President William Dudley, who says the US central bank should cut rates next week rather than waiting until September. The market still sees the chance of that being just 11%. Turning to today now and Commerce Department data out at 8:30 Eastern is expected to show the economy grew an annualized 2% in the second quarter. That compares with 1.4% in the first quarter when consumers slowed spending in the face of higher rates. Separately, durable goods are expected to have gained 0.3% in June after rising 0.1% in May. And initial claims for state unemployment benefits likely fell back from 10-month highs during the week to July 20. It got a temporary lift the previous week because of Hurricane Beryl. The labor market is gradually cooling as the Federal Reserve's rate increases from 2022 and 2023 slow demand. Earnings season continues on Thursday, Southwest Airlines reported lower Q2 profits this morning, but the fall was lower than forecast, owing to successful cost cutting. American Airlines will also report on Thursday. Flight demand is at record levels this summer, but United Delta, Alaska, and Ryanair have all delivered downbeat outlooks. The sector is grappling with overcapacity as airlines thought demand would be even higher. Union Pacific is expected to report a second-quarter profit above estimates. Price hikes and a pick-up in vehicle shipments are seen offsetting a fall in demand from coal transporters. And that is your US Morning Call.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

"Wall Street suffered its worst day of trading in 19 months as disappointment around earnings from Tesla and Google challenged the recent big-tech rally.The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index dropped 2.3% as a sell-off triggered its biggest single-day fall since December 2022.The technology-focused Nasdaq retreated 3.6%, its largest single-day decline since October 2022.Shares in Tesla sank 12% after it reported a 45% slump in quarterly profits amid discounting by electric carmakers. Alphabet, the owner of Google and YouTube, also fell 5% as investors scrutinized a slowdown in advertising growth.The two companies were the first out of the gate as America's tech giants update shareholders on their recent performance. Over the coming weeks, the rest of the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" tech heavyweights – Meta, owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp; Apple; Nvidia; Microsoft; and Amazon – are set to follow.""I can't help thinking [that] if the tech sector does sneeze, the whole market could catch it,"" said David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation.Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, said: ""Whilst Alphabet's news wasn't awful, the fact they're still ploughing billions into [artificial intelligence] has caused some to begin questioning when enough will be enough, or at least when the expenditure will deliver the kind of results investors have been salivating over elsewhere in the AI space.""Elon Musk's attempts to get investors to look anywhere but at the bottom line has also backfired. Even if Tesla's CEO insists the company isn't just a carmaker, until robots or robo-taxis start to make money, EVs are the only game in Tesla town, and margins have been wrung out.""Reuters contributed reportingCopyright (c) 2024 theguardian.com-NonSyndicated",2024-07-25,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240725:nNRAtcmhvh:1,Tesla,social

With Tesla down about 11% today and pushing down 30%-25% off the highs from a few weeks ago, and it's really all driven by the earnings and then ultimate information that drove those earnings centering around a $600 million to $700 million restructuring charge. Tesla is a very confusing stock in my opinion. They're confusing the Street with what they actually are. Are they an electric vehicle company, or are they going to be with battery storage? Is it going to be robotics? Is it going to be AI? Or could it be sum of all the above? And I think that sum of all the above is why Tesla is actually an interesting opportunity going forward as one of the Mag Seven, probably down the most of the Mag Seven over the last year or so. I think it's going to be a very opportunistic buy here given this entry point and the confusion surrounding the stock.

"TESLA INC (""TSLA-Q;TL0-F"")
- SHAREHOLDER ALERT: Pomerantz Law Firm Investigates Claims on Behalf
- of Investors of Tesla, Inc. - TSLA

     Pomerantz LLP is investigating claims on behalf of investors of Tesla,
Inc. (Tesla or the Company) (NASDAQ: TSLA). Such investors are advised to
contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980, ext. 7980.

     The investigation concerns whether Tesla and certain of its officers
and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful
business practices.

     [Click here for information about joining the class action]

     After the market closed on July 23, 2024, Tesla announced its Q2 2024
results, reporting lower earnings-per-share (EPS) and operating income than
anticipated. Specifically, EPS came in at $0.52 vs. $0.62 consensus and
$0.91 a year ago and, while operating margin was reported at 6.3% of sales
to improve from last quarter's mark of 5.5%, this figure landed below last
year's mark of 9.6%. In addition, although Tesla promised a fleet of
robotaxis and was optimistic regarding the Companys autonomous driving
system, market analysts reported that investors focused more on the
Company's Q2 EPS miss, disappointing operating margins and free cash flow
lines, and slower 2024 growth forecast.

     On this news, Teslas stock price fell $30.39 per share, or 12.33%, to
close at $215.99 per share on July 24, 2024.

     Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London,
Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the
areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by
the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar,
Pomerantz pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than
85 years later, Pomerantz continues in the tradition he established,
fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of
fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. The Firm has recovered billions
of dollars in damages awards on behalf of class members. See

"PATH DEADLINE ALERT: UiPath, Inc. (NYSE:PATH) Investors are Alerted of an Upcoming Deadline in Securities Fraud Class Action Contact BFA Law if you Suffered LossesUIPATH INC (""PATH-N;9UV-F"")
- PATH DEADLINE ALERT: UiPath, Inc. (NYSE:PATH) Investors are Alerted
- of an Upcoming Deadline in Securities Fraud Class Action - Contact
- BFA Law if you Suffered Losses

     Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces it
has filed a lawsuit against UiPath, Inc. (UiPath or the Company)
(NYSE:PATH) and certain of the Companys senior executives.

     If you suffered losses on your UiPath investment, you are encouraged
to submit your information at
https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.

     Investors have until August 19, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed
to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and
20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in
UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May
29, 2024 inclusive (the Class Period). The case is pending in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack
Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be
found https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.

     What is the Lawsuit About?

     The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants
made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of
UiPaths turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the
Company was executing against that strategy, and were seeing [the] results
in the deal quality and the customer quality, asserted that our strategic
investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well
for continued momentum, and that theres no doubt theres [been] better
execution since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.

     These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In
truth, UiPaths turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and
inconsistent execution plagued the Companys overhauled go-to-market
strategy. Additionally, UiPaths AI-powered Business Automation Platform
caused confusion among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled.
As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or
expanding large multiyear deals.

     On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert
Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial
results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150
million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several
factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate
execution strategy to scale the Companys AI-powered growth products to
reach their full potential, and that AI had create[ed] a little bit of
confusion with our customers. Ui Path also described how the investments we
have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations,
[and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs while experiencing
contract execution challenges on large deals.

     This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share,
or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per
share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.

"A growing number of investigations and legal complaints are targeting Tesla's claims that its cars are ""Full Self-Driving,"" scrutinizing the company's decisions to brand and market its suite of driver-assistance technologies for evidence of potential fraud.The U.S. Justice Department is probing the company's marketing of both Full Self-Driving and Autopilot, Tesla's advanced driver-assistance systems. California's Department of Motor Vehicles is also reviewing those features in light of provisions, including a 2022 law prohibiting companies from using marketing and language that would ""lead a reasonable person to believe that the feature allows the vehicle to function as an autonomous vehicle."" Tesla has received inquiries from the Securities and Exchange Commission related to its claims to investors, according to news reports and public filings. And a civil lawsuit in California represents drivers who say they were defrauded by the company's claims and are seeking refunds and damages over their purchases.At issue is whether the term Full Self-Driving implies that the cars are autonomous — meaning drivers don't need to pay attention. In recent court filings, Tesla says that the cars are not ""autonomous"" and that its user manuals and sensors alert drivers to the need to hold the wheel and keep their eyes on the road. Yet in a post on X last month, Tesla's head of Autopilot, Ashok Elluswamy, used the word, writing that the cars ""have the most autonomous capability compared to any production car.""Tesla, CEO Elon Musk and Elluswamy did not respond to requests for comment. The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, through spokespeople, declined to comment.The wave of scrutiny comes less than a month before Tesla is due to unveil what it calls a robotaxi, a dedicated vehicle that would run a version of its Full Self-Driving software, shuttling passengers between destinations without a driver. (It has no known production timeline, and Tesla is known for making ambitious product announcements without concrete delivery plans.)Many of the probes and lawsuits weigh similar claims made by Musk.Most Tesla cars today come with a feature it calls Autopilot, a suite of software that allows vehicles to keep their distance behind others, maintain a set speed and steer on highways, following the trajectory of lane lines. The company has for years offered an upgrade package called Full Self-Driving, which costs $8,000 (down from $15,000) — or $99 a month — and enables its vehicles to navigate city and residential streets on their own, provided the driver demonstrates they are paying attention.Tesla promised customers years ago that this upgrade would turn cars into an appreciable asset — meaning their value would increase over time — after they one day become autonomous through a software update. That has yet to happen, and that's what the California lawsuit is about.""Contrary to Tesla's repeated promises that it would have a fully self-driving car within months or a year, Tesla has never been remotely close to achieving that goal,"" reads the civil complaint in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, which is seeking class-action certification. In addition to financial remedies, it asks for an injunction prohibiting Tesla from continuing to market its technology in ""deceptive and misleading"" ways.""One of the arguments we make is you can't get more self-driving than fully self-driving,"" said attorney Andrew Kirtley, who is representing customers in the Autopilot class-action suit.Among the statements under scrutiny, according to interviews and documents: Musk's 2019 pronouncement that Tesla would put 1 million robotaxis on the road by 2020 and Tesla's assertions that its vehicles have all the hardware needed to deploy the Full Self-Driving feature. The Northern California civil lawsuit specifically cites Musk's assertion on a 2016 conference call that a Tesla would be able to drive itself from Los Angeles to New York ""by the end of next year without the need for a single touch.""In that case, drivers allege that they were misled into paying for a feature that still hasn't materialized. Meanwhile, at least two dozen people have died in crashes in which Tesla's driver-assistance features were engaged, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; in some cases, they were alleged to be driving under the influence or distracted.In Tesla's response to the California lawsuit, the company claims its driver-assistance features — including steering, accelerating and merging — make the cars ""self-driving, but not autonomous."" It has made the same claim on its website, saying that Autopilot and Full Self-Driving ""features do not make the vehicle autonomous"" and that its systems are ""intended to be used only with a fully attentive driver.""But legal experts question the distinction: ""When I hear self-driving and autonomous I kind of hear the same thing,"" said Anthony Casey, a University of Chicago law professor, adding that the legal question will revolve around ""what would a normal person hear"" in the term ""self-driving.""Still, he said, the bar for proving that Tesla's marketing claims amount to fraud, particularly criminal fraud, is high. ""You also would have to show that they intended to get [a person] to buy it by misleading you,"" Casey said.Tesla is far from the first company to tussle with regulators and federal officials over the ambitious promises of its tech. Legal experts said other companies in similar situations have made the same argument Tesla is making: that failure to deliver on its promises is not a crime.An attorney for Elizabeth Holmes, the disgraced Silicon Valley wunderkind who promoted a medical device that could purportedly perform a battery tests with a tiny amount of blood, made this argument explicitly during Holmes's 2021 criminal trial. ""Failure is not a crime,"" the attorney argued. ""Trying your hardest and coming up short is not a crime."" A jury disagreed: Holmes was convicted and is serving an 11-year prison sentence.In the ongoing Justice Department probe, investigators have focused on Tesla's promises, according to John Bernal, a former Tesla Autopilot employee who was interviewed by an FBI agent and a representative of the U.S. Transportation Department for five hours in 2022.""They kept saying over and over again their focus is in terms of marketing with the namesake,"" Bernal said, referring to terms such as Autopilot and Full Self-Driving. ""They believe that those namesakes imply a higher sense of functionality than they actually deliver.""Bernal said ""their main holy grail info they were seeking was they wanted physical, written documentation in advertisement or marketing form"" that Tesla was billing its driver-assistance systems as autonomous. Bernal did not have evidence of that, he said. He said the officials told him their investigation had stretched back to 2018 and involved interviews with numerous employees.Federal officials have focused at least in part on a 2016 Tesla marketing video, set to the Rolling Stones song ""Paint It Black,"" that purported to show a Tesla maneuvering near the company's headquarters on its own, which came up repeatedly in the interview with Bernal. ""The person in the driver's seat is only there for legal reasons,"" the 2016 video's opening slide reads. ""He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself.""A Tesla official later acknowledged, after reporting by the New York Times, that the video was staged and the car in fact crashed during filming.At the time, Musk was deep into a push to make Teslas capable of autonomy, an effort that led to heated back-and-forths between him and the engineers responsible for delivering. At one point, Musk left a car during a test drive after the software performed badly, slamming the door shut and walking back toward Tesla's offices.""Nothing f---ing works,"" Musk fumed before storming off, according to a person with knowledge of the episode, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.A recent Musk biography said Musk frequently would show up to Tesla's office dismayed by the software's performance.A few months after the incident newly detailed by The Washington Post, Tesla released the ""Paint It Black"" video.Tesla, in response to another lawsuit, called the video an ""aspirational"" demonstration of its software's potential capabilities.Similar videos have been used in other cases — even against another electric vehicle manufacturer. Trevor Milton, the founder of electric truck start-up Nikola, was found guilty of misleading investors in a federal fraud case that alleged a video demonstration of its truck's capabilities, in reality, showed the truck rolling downhill rather than propelling itself on its own.Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor, said the civil case would be most likely to gain momentum in the short term, given the extended nature of federal investigations and the lower burden of proof in civil cases.""There were some representations, especially video, that they made … look better than it actually was,"" he said. ""And I think people felt manipulated in that context: that they overrated how quickly they could do things or how well it could perform and that kind of thing as a sales technique.""Tobias said customers' reliance on those claims could entitle them to refunds.Musk had been pushing for autonomous capability in his cars for years, in ways that were at times inconsistent with Tesla's level of progress and to the chagrin of safety officials who had not anticipated such a brazen effort to bill consumer vehicles as self-driving, The Post has reported.Around late 2014, software entrepreneur Dan O'Dowd said he'd learned Musk was planning to deliver an autonomous vehicle by the end of the following year. Now a vocal Tesla critic, O'Dowd was at the time a contractor for Tesla whose company helped streamline the Autopilot technology to take up less computer space.In 2019, Musk made another audacious promise: to put 1 million robotaxis on the road by 2020, in part by utilizing the privately owned Teslas sitting in people's driveways. ""The fleet wakes up with an over-the-air update,"" Musk said at the time.That didn't happen. Instead, Tesla has focused on smaller developments, releasing the first iteration of its Full Self-Driving software, known as Full Self-Driving Beta, in late 2020, followed by successive improvements such as better recognition of road signs and lane markings and aiming for smoother driving. Musk launched the latest version of the software, known as V12, this year, touting it as a revolutionary leap forward.In April, Musk made a new promise: ""Tesla Robotaxi unveil on 8/8,"" he wrote. On Thursday, however, Bloomberg News reported that Tesla planned to delay the event to October.Tom Gorman, former senior counsel in the SEC's division of enforcement, said Musk's robotaxi statements could also be reviewed by the agency, which would scrutinize the promises in light of investor decisions. Musk's robotaxi promise was made amid slumping stock prices in the first half of 2024.""If he really doesn't have the ability to do what he's doing … they'd go after him for that,"" Gorman said. ""If you're saying, 'I am going to have a completely self-driving car and it can drive you around the planet completely by yourself two weeks from now,' and you're starting to hype that, he'll probably get sued.""Copyright (c) 2024 The Washington Post",2024-07-16,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240711:nNRAt7xk6e:31,Tesla,governance
"Craig Trudellin response to Tesla investors reapproving his massive compensation plan, Elon Musk offered outlandish predictions that he can enrich shareholders all over again.After Tesla's general counsel confirmed in mid-June that investors supported awarding stock options to Musk worth as much as US$55.8 billion (HK$435.24 billion), the chief executive officer said the company's robot-making effort may one day dwarf its car business.Tesla has all of two humanoid robot prototypes plucking battery cells off the end of a production line in California and placing them in shipping containers. ""Quite a few"" others are cruising around the company's offices in Palo Alto, Musk said during the company's annual meeting.The CEO isn't expecting the bot - called Optimus - to go into limited production until next year, when Tesla could put a few thousand to the test in its own factories.He nevertheless offered a pie-in-the-sky projection that Tesla may one day make around US$1 trillion of profit annually from the product, without offering a time frame.""If the price-to-earnings multiple is, say, I don't know, 20 or 25, something like that, that would mean a US$20 trillion market cap from Optimus alone,"" Musk said. ""It's within the realm of possibility for Tesla to achieve a valuation 10 times that of the most valuable company today.""Work on robots was at the center of an ultimatum Musk laid down earlier this year.The CEO openly pressured Tesla's board to boost his stake in the company to around 25 percent, saying that he otherwise preferred to build artificial intelligence and robotics products elsewhere.Musk has a long track record of setting stretch goals, and a spotty history of achieving them on time - if at all. While he was proven correct, for example, when he said in 2019 that the pursuit of self-driving technology could one day make Tesla a half-trillion-dollar company, his repeated predictions that Tesla is on the verge of turning its customers' cars into robotaxis haven't panned out.This also isn't the first business within Tesla that Musk has predicted will one day rival carmaking.The company continues to generate only a fraction of sales with its energy generation and storage products, years after the CEO said it could be roughly the same size as Tesla's automotive operations.Speaking of the auto business, Musk was much more measured.""It's tough sledding out there,"" he said, noting that General Motors, Ford Motor and other manufacturers have dialed back plans for electric vehicle production.""Now Tesla, we're gonna increase, but it is not an easy market.""bloomberg news (tns)Copyright © 2024 GC Media Teamwork Limited",2024-06-25,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240625:nNRAt2o9bi:1,Tesla,governance
"IF YOU cannot stomach defending a billionaire's right to make more money, you'd best avert your eyes now. Perhaps you can raise them heavenward -- you will be in good company with Tesla shareholders and other corporate rubberneckers as they contemplate the debacle of Elon Musk's pay package.In January, Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick stood up for the little guy by nullifying Musk's US$56 billion pay package at Tesla. Turns out, the little guy didn't want any saving. On Jun 13, shareholders again overwhelmingly voted to award Tesla's chief executive the same pay package they'd approved in 2018. This, despite McCormick's finding earlier this year that the 2018 package was unfair because she'd considered two basic issues -- price and process -- and found them both problematic.It's fairly easy to get behind her dim view of Tesla's compensation approval process. Back in 2018, the independence of the compensation committee was laughable. One committee member had known Musk for 15 years and another had regularly vacationed with his family.The ""fair price"" issue, though, raises interesting questions. What yardstick do we use to find a US$56 billion payout ""unfathomable"", as McCormick had? The comparison multiples are quantitatively large, but outrage is qualitative. Also -- and this isn't McCormick's fault -- it seems a little belated to be fathoming ballooning CEO pay packages now; I suspect most market watchers ran out of fathoms many, many zeroes ago.In any case, the judge noted that Musk's pay package was ""historically unprecedented"", but hadn't Tesla's performance and sheer fact of existence been equally unparalleled? From March 2018 to end-2023, Musk achieved a total shareholder return of nearly 1,100 per cent, the company had argued.McCormick hadn't bought that, however, finding that Tesla had failed to prove that Musk's efforts had solely or directly led to the firm's success, or that his pay package had directly driven his efforts.Does this strike players of the white-collar Hunger Games as a little idealistic? Demanding a sole or direct causality disregards the Faustian pact that underpins the corporate world -- in return for getting all the bucks, the buck stops with you. You receive both credit and blame, however far removed you are from actual events. That's the deal.Then, there is the deal that Tesla shareholders made six years ago, when they wagered that Musk couldn't achieve certain targets in exchange for this ""unfathomable"" payout. The judge said they didn't know what they were doing when they made that bet, so she unmade it for them.But in 2024, even with the extra information that the judge insisted they previously lacked, shareholders made their own calculations which resulted in a similar bet: Musk might walk if he doesn't get his money; few want to find out what a post-Musk Tesla looks like, so they will give him his money.So now that Tesla shareholders have shoved their chips back onto the table for the second time, what's next? It's possible that the courts find other flaws with the 2024 vote, and Musk's payout remains stymied. But past a point, players in the great game of capitalism should be free to make their own bets and potential mistakes. And even if the courts do not like how this game is played, they ought to eventually let the chips fall where they may.Copyright © 2024 SPH",2024-06-25,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240625:nNRAt29w81:1,Tesla,governance

"Tesla's battle to reinstate Elon Musk's $45bn (£35bn) pay package is far from over, according to legal experts, despite shareholders backing the chief executive's remuneration deal.Investors in the electric carmaker re-ratified the pay deal on Thursday after it had been struck down by a judge in the US state of Delaware. The company's chair, Robin Deynholm has already pledged to ""put it back in front of the court"".However, doubts remain over whether Musk will be able to access the share-based package.The lawyer representing the Tesla shareholder Richard Tornetta, who brought the lawsuit that led to Musk's pay package being nullified, said in a statement on Thursday that the vote was ""deeply flawed"".""We believe that the ratification vote that Elon demanded and coerced is deeply flawed as a matter of law, legally ineffective and does not impact our case. We will respond to any arguments raised in due course,"" said Greg Varallo, a partner at the law firm Bernstein, Litowitz, Berger &amp; Grossmann.Judge Kathaleen McCormick threw out Musk's pay package in January, ruling that the board members had been insufficiently independent from the Tesla CEO while negotiating the package.Ann Lipton, a professor at Tulane law school, said the Tesla vote was ""unprecedented"" and the litigation around the deal would continue in Delaware, where Tesla was incorporated when the original pay deal was agreed in 2018.""It's simply not clear legally what the effect [of the vote] will be,"" said Lipton. ""Assuming there's no settlement, the litigation will continue before Chancellor McCormick. Tesla will argue that the new vote cures any defects in the original award and therefore Musk's pay is reinstated; the plaintiffs will argue it does not.""Any decision by McCormick is likely to be appealed against by the losing side and will go to the Delaware supreme court, said Lipton. ""At that point, the Delaware supreme court will have two issues before it: was McCormick right to strike the package originally? And if so, does the new vote restore the package?""Eric Talley, a professor at Columbia Law School, said comments by Musk in the run-up to Thursday's vote could be viewed as coercing shareholders, pointing to Musk threatening in January to build AI and robotics products outside the company if he did not gain enough voting control.""To the extent Tesla is going to use this vote as a reason to reverse the chancery court's holding, I'd expect a big argument,"" said Talley. ""In particular, there is a plausible argument that today's vote was the product of coercion … and thus not valid.""A Delaware court is likely to require Tesla to prove that the latest process was carried out independently from Musk and the vote was ""procedurally fair"", said Brian Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School.""This is an unprecedented situation, so it's important to keep in mind the pleading burdens are all against the board … this isn't done, yet,"" he said.Appearing in front of shareholders after winning the vote, Musk said: ""I just want to start off by saying, hot damn, I love you guys!""Thursday's Tesla shareholder meeting also voted in favour of moving Tesla's incorporation from Delaware to Texas, where the company is headquartered. However, litigation related to the pay package will remain in Delaware, according to McCormick, who wrote last month that she did not expect Tesla to ""litigate any matter related to this action anywhere but Delaware"".New pay packages for Musk will fall under the law of the company's new home, however, said Talley. ""Now that Tesla is reincorporating to Texas, going-forward decisions would fall under Texas law,"" he said.Copyright (c) 2024 theguardian.com-NonSyndicated",2024-06-14,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240614:nNRAsz01g8:21,Tesla,governance
"Billionaire tells shareholders 'hot damn, I love you guys' after retaining largest-ever executive pay package at US-listed firm• Musk's pay package not a done deal, say legal expertsTesla shareholders have approved a $45bn (£35.3bn) pay deal for CEO Elon Musk, following a fiercely contested referendum on his leadership.The result, announced on Thursday, comes as the billionaire tycoon fights to retain the largest-ever compensation package granted to an executive at a US-listed company.""I just want to start off by saying, hot damn, I love you guys!"" a gleeful Musk said as he appeared on stage following the vote.The vote took place after a Delaware judge nullified Musk's payment – then worth around $56bn (£43.9)– in January, on the grounds that Tesla's board could not be considered independent from Musk's influence and reached that dollar figure through an illegitimate process.The result is a victory for Musk and the Tesla board after they ardently campaigned for shareholders to approve the deal. It could serve as a rebuttal to the judge's ruling that struck down the award – making it easier for Tesla's board to argue that shareholders were properly informed about the payment package, and the board members' ties to Musk, before casting their votes.Tesla's board warned Musk could turn away from the company if the package wasn't approved, while Musk claimed on Wednesday evening that he had wide support of investors.Prominent shareholders such as Norway's sovereign wealth fund and the California State Teachers' Retirement System announced they would vote against the payment in the lead-up to the vote, while proxy advisory firms Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services also opposed the award.The vote does not automatically mean that Musk will receive the money, however, and there are likely to be further disputes. There are still numerous legal arguments around whether the board can be considered independent, and whether the package can be considered fair after the judge ruled otherwise.It is also possible new lawsuits may arise over the vote, potentially bringing the case back in front of a judge and raising the prospect of a protracted legal battle. Shareholders also approved a measure to move Tesla's legal home from Delaware to Texas, potentially further complicating any challenges.Tesla originally devised Musk's payment package in 2017, setting conditions for the CEO to receive 12 different tranches of stock options depending on whether the company hit certain revenue and market targets. Shareholders approved that package by a wide margin in 2018, but one investor filed a suit claiming that the board had been misleading and the package was unfair.Judge Kathaleen McCormick, who oversees Delaware's court of chancery, ruled that Tesla's board conducted a ""deeply flawed"" process to determine Musk's payment. McCormick found that the board was rife with personal conflicts and stacked with Musk's close allies, such as his former divorce attorney.Tesla's board, which is likely to appeal McCormick's ruling, sought to remedy her decision with a shareholder vote. Despite McCormick's criticism of the pay package, the board put forth the same deal that the judge rejected – albeit now worth less money due to a fall in Tesla's share price.Copyright (c) 2024 theguardian.com-NonSyndicated",2024-06-14,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240613:nNRAsyny2a:80,Tesla,governance
"Shortly after Tesla announced that shareholders re-approved Elon Musk's controversial, $50 billion pay package Thursday - and further solidified his place as one of the richest men in the world - the crowd at the annual shareholder meeting in Austin erupted in cheers as the elated CEO jumped in the air and took the stage.""Hot damn, I love you guys!"" he said, as his fans chanted: ""Elon! Elon!""It was a decisive outcome after months of uncertainty for the electric-vehicle maker, as Musk threatened to pull back from the company amid uncertainty shortly before the pay package was invalidated by a Delaware judge earlier this year.After his victory was announced, Musk spent nearly an hour making bold claims about the future of his company, declaring that it's about to embark on not just a ""new chapter"" but a ""new book.""""It's actually conceivable, and it's within the realm of possibility for Tesla to achieve a valuation 10 times that of the most valuable company today,"" he said. ""So when I say it's like we're starting a new book, it's going to be the best book.""A Delaware judge threw out the pay package, worth as much as $56 billion, earlier this year, arguing that the process that led to the deal had been unfair. As part of the deal, Musk was granted stock options as Tesla hit certain valuation milestones, accumulating massive amounts of shares that led to a record pay deal and played a hand in making Musk the richest person in the world.Musk, in a Wednesday night post on his social media platform, X, said the measure passed by a ""wide margin."" The final results were not immediately available Thursday.The shareholder vote does not immediately restore Musk's pay, but it sends a strong signal that he has the broad support of Tesla's investors. In a January post on X, Musk threatened to pull back from Tesla and build futuristic technology - such as robotics and artificial intelligence - ""outside of Tesla,"" before the invalidated pay package threatened to further erode his control. Such a future was a daunting prospect for the electric-vehicle maker, which reported a steeper-than-expected 55 percent plunge in profit for the first quarter.In the months leading up to the vote, investors large and small were split on whether to support the package. While some major shareholders criticized him as a distracted leader who doesn't deserve such a reward, others lauded him for being a generational genius.""Our answer is clear, loud and unequivocal: Tesla is better with Elon. Tesla is Elon,"" said Ron Baron, a billionaire and investor in Tesla, who added that Musk was indispensable to Tesla and that his compensation must recognize that fact.Investors and Musk's supporters, including X CEO Linda Yaccarino, applauded the results late Wednesday. Musk - who would have remained among the richest people regardless of whether he kept the pay package - also pledged in a post Wednesday night that he would make Tesla the most valuable company on Earth.Brad Lander, the New York City comptroller whose office owns about 3.4 million shares of Tesla and invests on behalf of public employees, said he voted against the package because of Tesla's struggles and Musk's divided attention among his several companies. Musk's Wednesday night tweet announcing the outcome, Lander said, was ""more evidence of the failure of corporate governance at Tesla.""""This is not how the votes are supposed to be counted and made public,"" he said. ""If this unprecedented pay package is approved, as long-term investors in Tesla, we expect a CEO who is deeply committed to the company's growth rather than other business ventures.""Ross Gerber, a longtime investor in Tesla and a vocal critic of Musk, said the results of the vote are great for Musk but do not address the company's current woes, including weak sales, global competition and mass layoffs.""If they put as much effort into selling cars … that would help,"" he said.Musk and a Tesla spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment late Wednesday.While several key investors were vocal about their position ahead of Thursday's meeting, others stayed silent, leaving the result unclear until Musk's X post late Wednesday. Tesla's largest investors - Vanguard Group, BlackRock and State Street, which collectively own about 17 percent of Tesla stock - did not publicly state their positions. None responded to requests for comment.After the decision from Delaware's Court of Chancery in January, Musk also unleashed on the state where Tesla - and many businesses - are incorporated.""Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware,"" he posted, before launching a poll and announcing a decision to hold a shareholder vote on incorporating in Texas instead. On Thursday, Tesla said shareholders passed that measure, too.Copyright (c) 2024 The Washington Post",2024-06-14,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240614:nNRAsytatc:1,Tesla,governance

Video Transcript:
Investors may have said yes to giving Elon Musk $56 billion again. In some ways, the enormous payout is so absurd it aligned shareholders with Musk. But months of high stakes hectoring revealed gross hypocrisy and changed the facts. The electric automakers boss might have won the vote, but he has proved why he shouldn't have. This mess started in January when a Delaware judge struck down a 2018 pay package awarded to Musk on the grounds that it was unfair to ill-informed shareholders. Tesla put the issue back to a vote, hoping to reiterate investors consent from six years ago to sway the legal case. As of now, those votes are still being tallied. But on Wednesday evening, Musk said in a post on social network X that a critical mass of shareholders had lodged their support. The pay packet was reasonable in its way. Sure, its magnitude seemed crazy, but so were the milestones Musk needed to hit, including growing market value 11-fold. Crucially fixing the impasse could have proceeded addressing other issues, and issues need addressing. Leave aside Tesla's strategic drift, or whether Musk appropriately balances the carmakers interests with his other companies. Instead, look at Tesla's executive departures: Drew Bellino, battery chief; Rebecca Tinucci, who led the company's charging network, Zach Kirkhorn, the finance chief one seen as Musk's potential heir. In a circular argument, Musk is now the crucial fulcrum on which Tesla rests by pure attrition. Yet despite it all, Tesla boasts an eye-popping valuation, one reinforced by Musk's inimitable presence. The strongest argument to support him is retaining that magic. But the fight against a loud chorus of dissenting shareholders reeks of hypocrisy and strengthens arguments that Musk's grip is too tight. Tesla launched a PR campaign to whip the vote with greater enthusiasm than it's ever marketed its own cars. Musk lambastic California's CalPERS, which said it is voting no, as having no honor. Board missives darkly implied that Musk has other places he could abscond to. Worst of all, it's still unclear whether a vote will actually sway Delaware that some shareholders had qualms about what they did six years ago after all this is reasonable. After all, Musk knows the feeling. After agreeing to buy Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, he tried to terminate the deal of a claims about inauthentic user numbers. He felt the facts had changed. His attempt failed, perhaps because of litigation, but shareholders are not bound by any contract to support him. Acting as if they are, is Tesla's weakest argument of all.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

"San Francisco Tesla shareholders are voting to approve a US$56 billion (S$75.5 billion) pay package for co-founder Elon Musk and to move its legal home to Texas, Mr Musk said on social media platform X on June 12, adding that the passage was by wide margins.Overwhelming shareholder approval of the largest remuneration terms in US corporate history could allay investor concerns about Mr Musk's future at the company while giving the electric carmaker ammunition in its fight to reverse a court decision to void the pay package.Mr Musk would still face a lengthy legal battle to convince the Delaware judge who said the Tesla board was ""beholden"" to him, while potentially fielding fresh lawsuits over the latest vote.""Even if the shareholders do approve the old package, it is not clear that the Delaware court will allow that vote to be effective,"" said UC Berkeley law professor Adam Badawi.The result will be announced at a meeting at Tesla's headquarters in Texas at 9.30pm GMT on June 13.A person familiar with the preliminary voting tally said a combination of big institutional investors and retail investor votes got the ""yes"" result over the line.Tesla shareholders also cast ballots on other proposals, including the move of Tesla's legal headquarters from Delaware to Texas, as well as the re-election of two board members: Mr Musk's brother Kimbal Musk and Mr James Murdoch, son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.Some investors viewed the vote on Mr Musk's pay as a test of confidence in his leadership. While he is undoubtedly Tesla's driving force and is credited with much of its success, the company has seen slowing sales and profits in the last few years.Tesla's stock has lost nearly 60 per cent of its value from its peak in 2021, when Mr Musk started selling billions of dollars worth of his stake partly to help finance his purchase of social media giant Twitter, sparking concerns that he would be spread too thin.He now runs six companies, including rocket-builder SpaceX, X -- formerly Twitter -- and the artificial intelligence (AI) company xA1, which Mr Musk created in 2023.Shareholders, led by major institutional investors, call such compensation far too generous for a leader who is splitting his time between six companies and is now presiding over falling sales and a strategic upheaval at Tesla.The pay package would enable Mr Musk to strengthen ownership ""at the expense of diluting the value of those belonging to other shareholders"", Ms Marcie Frost, chief executive of the California Public Employees' Retirement System, said on June 12.Tesla has been drumming up support for Mr Musk's pay package, especially from retail investors, who make up an unusually high percentage of its ownership base but who often do not vote.Company executives have posted messages on X, saying Mr Musk is critical to Tesla's success.The board said the world's richest person deserves the package because he hit all the ambitious targets on market value, revenue and profitability.The pay package is also needed to keep Mr Musk devoted to Tesla, the board said, even though the Delaware judge said the 2018 pay plan failed to make sure that Mr Musk committed a substantial amount of time to Tesla.Mr Musk has threatened to build AI and robotics products outside Tesla if he fails to gain enough voting control, which requires the 2018 pay package to be approved.The Delaware court that invalidated the compensation package had said the plan was proposed by a conflicted board with close personal and financial ties to its top executive.The board held the shareholder vote as a way to bolster its appeal of the ruling, in which the judge cited the board's failure to fully inform shareholders before approving the pay package in 2018.Tulane University corporate law professor Ann Lipton said: ""How the shareholders vote now doesn't really answer the question as to whether the board violated its duties in 2018, and that's the issue on appeal.""Mr Musk will have to wait months or years to get his pay package restored as appeals wind their way up to Delaware's Supreme Court.

"Tesla shareholders voted to approve CEO Elon Musk's contested pay package, currently estimated to be worth more than $45 billion.The results were announced on a preliminary basis during Tesla's annual shareholder meeting, resulting in boisterous cheers from the investors in attendance. The decision comes after weeks of Musk and the company trying to gin up support through letters to shareholders, social media advertisements and incentives like Tesla factory tours.Board members say the vote should shore up Tesla's future by keeping Musk focused on the company. Musk has come under fire from some shareholders for being too distracted with his other ventures, which include SpaceX, the Boring Company, Neuralink, and the social media platform X.The pay package ""was, and fundamentally still is, about retaining Elon's attention and motivating him to focus on achieving astonishing growth for our company,"" board chair Robyn Denholm wrote in a June letter to shareholders.Why did Tesla hold a second pay package vote?The pay package initially passed a 2018 vote with 73% of voted shares in support, but a Delaware judge voided the compensation package earlier this year.Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Delaware Court of Chancery sided with a shareholder who challenged the package, describing it as an ""unfathomable sum"" that was unfair to shareholders. The shareholder who had filed the lawsuit took issue with Tesla's board, accusing its members – which include Musk's brother – of having too close of ties to the CEO.The vote does not automatically restore Musk's pay, but it does act as evidence that shareholders continue to approve the compensation package.Who voted in favor?More than 40% of Tesla's common stock is held by nonprofessional shareholders as of Thursday, according to data from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. That may have helped Musk's pay package win approval, since many of those shareholders are loyal Musk fans who want to see the CEO take the company from an EV manufacturer to a leader in AI and robotics.Musk has made clear he would be ""uncomfortable"" developing artificial intelligence at Tesla without boosting his current 13% stake in the company to 25%.""Shareholders at the end of the day knew that voting no would risk Musk potentially eventually leaving as CEO,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a Thursday note.

Why a Delaware judge struck down Tesla CEO's $55 billion payday.Just how big is this pay package?The pay package's value varies depending on Tesla's stock price, and was valued as high as $56 billion before stocks took a dip. The rewards are tied to Musk's ability to increase Tesla's market value.The median annual compensation for other Tesla employees last year was $45,811.Marcie Frost, CEO of the California Public Employees' Retirement System, called the compensation package ""exorbitant"" in a Wednesday press release.""The compensation is excessive when compared to executives at peer companies, highly dilutive to shareholders, and isn't tied to the long-term profitability of Tesla,"" Frost said in the statement.Tesla shares are down more than 50% from their peak in late 2021.

"Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has said he is in line for a record-breaking payout worth roughly a quarter of his net worth.Tesla shareholders will vote on Thursday on whether the world's third richest person will receive $56 billion (£44bn) as part of a performance-based deal first agreed in 2018.

"The manager of one of the largest pension funds in the US said it will vote against Elon Musk's ""ridiculous"" pay deal as Tesla campaigns for its reinstatement.Shareholders in the electric carmaker are voting on the $56bn compensation package – the largest ever granted to an executive at a US-listed company – after it was thrown out by a Delaware judge earlier this year.Ahead of Tesla's annual shareholders meeting Thursday, Chris Ailman, chief investment officer of the California State Teachers' Retirement System, known as CalSTRS, told CNBC that he would cast a ""no"" vote.""Even if these cars had AI in them, they are not worth 60-times earnings,"" Ailman said Monday. ""That is absurd.""The California pension fund has about 4.7m shares of Tesla and manages a total of $333bn in assets.The shareholder vote is over Musk's $56bn compensation package that was established by the company's board, and backed by shareholders, in 2018. CalSTRS voted against the deal then, too.At the time, the board said Musk would get the payout if Tesla met revenue, profit and share price targets. The company would ultimately meet all targets in 2022.But back in January, Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick ruled in favor of a Tesla shareholder who argued that the company's board inappropriately set the pay package. The judge agreed Musk's pay package was unnecessary in keeping Musk dedicated to Tesla, an argument that company officers made during the trial.""Swept up by the rhetoric of 'all upside', or perhaps starry-eyed by Musk's superstar appeal, the board never asked the $55.8bn question: was the plan ever necessary for Tesla to retain Musk and achieve its goals,"" McCormick wrote in her decision.While the shareholder vote is over the compensation package, it's also largely being seen as a referendum on Musk's leadership of the company.Some shareholders have thrown their weight behind Musk. ""Without his relentless drive and uncompromising standards, there would be no Tesla,"" the billionaire investor Ron Baron said last week.But others argue that Musk's sights have turned elsewhere. Musk stirred controversy in 2022 when he purchased Twitter for $44bn and renamed it X. He sold $22.9bn of his Tesla shares to finance the purchase. Musk is also leading SpaceX, which is trying to achieve his goal of getting humans to Mars.""He needs to focus in on, either on cars, either on X, or on going to Mars,"" Ailman said. ""And I think his heart really is in going to Mars.""CalSTRs joins Norway's $1.7tn sovereign wealth fund, Tesla's eighth-largest shareholder, in its plan to vote against the pay package.The Norwegian fund said that, while Musk's leadership has generated ""significant value"", the fund is still ""concerned about the total size of the award, the structure given performance triggers, dilution and lack of mitigation of key person risk"".On Thursday, as Tesla worked to shore up support, Musk retweeted a message from the company urging shareholders to vote in favor of his pay deal.

"IndiaIndia, June 10 -- Elon Musk may step down as Tesla CEO, the company's chairperson Robyn Denholm said ahead of Tesla shareholders meeting this week where they will vote on his $56 billion pay package. In a letter to Tesla shareholders, Robyn Denholm said, ""Elon is not a typical executive, and Tesla is not a typical company.So, the typical way in which companies compensate key executives is not going to drive results for Tesla. Motivating someone like Elon requires something different. These votes are about fairness, respect and the future of Tesla.""Robyn Denholm stressed that if shareholders reject the pay package, Elon Musk may step down and decamp to ""other places"" without proper motivation. She said, ""Nor does he face any shortage of ideas and other places he can make an incredible difference in the world. We want those ideas, that energy and that time to be at Tesla, for the benefit of you, our owners.

"Tesla's shares are down 28% this year. It has warned of ""notably"" slower growth as sales in its second-largest market, China, fall. A defect forced a recall of its highly anticipated latest product. The chief executive spends a lot of time at other companies or generating controversy. How do you reward him? With a record-breaking $56bn pay deal, if Tesla gets its way at its annual meeting on Thursday.Elon Musk's pay package – the largest ever granted to an executive at a US-listed company – is not based on Tesla's current, or future, performance. It was granted in 2018, and built around targets for Tesla's stock value, revenue and profitability.The targets seemed steep at the time, but after three extraordinary surges – in Tesla production, demand for electric cars, and the group's share price – every goal was cleared by 2022. The company's transformation into the world's most highly valued carmaker propelled Musk into the ranks of the world's very richest people.Back in January, a judge slammed on the brakes. Voiding the pay arrangement after a legal challenge by a Tesla shareholder, the Delaware court of chancery called his remuneration ""an unfathomable sum"", and questioned whether compensating Musk at such levels was necessary to retain him as chief executive and achieve the company's goals.Tesla was not prepared to take that decision in its stride. ""Elon has not been paid for any of his work for Tesla for the past six years that has helped to generate significant growth and stockholder value,"" Robyn Denholm, Tesla's chair, said in April, adding that the ruling had been ""fundamentally unfair, and inconsistent with the will of the stockholders who voted for it"".The company organised a re-vote, urging investors to endorse the deal again. While the carmaker has sought to underline how the arrangement was tied to previous performance, the ballot is also seen by some as a referendum on the current state of the company, and Musk's leadership.Denholm appealed to shareholders again last week, saying there was a risk Musk would step back from Tesla if they did not back his pay package this week. ""If Tesla is to retain Elon's attention and motivate him to continue to devote his time, energy, ambition and vision to deliver comparable results in the future, we must stand by our deal,"" she wrote.Denholm added: ""This is obviously not about the money. We all know Elon is one of the wealthiest people on the planet, and he would remain so even if Tesla were to renege on the commitment we made in 2018.""Investors are being asked to endorse two proposals: Musk's pay, and the relocation of Tesla's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. Musk signalled he planned to do the latter after January's ruling, which prompted him to say that companies should never incorporate in Delaware.Tesla is likely to win approval for Musk's remuneration, according to Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush and a veteran follower of the company, albeit ""not by a wide margin"". Many shareholders in the company ""understand the biggest asset of Tesla is Elon Musk,"" Ives said.The two largest proxy advisory firms – which advise investors on how to vote – have come out against Musk's pay. Glass Lewis and ISS both described it as ""excessive"", prompting angry responses from Tesla. Glass Lewis had used ""faulty logic,"" it claimed, while suggesting that ISS had missed the point.Beyond the ramifications for Musk's wealth, the vote over his pay will also test the power that proxy advisers wield over a company such as Tesla, which has a multitude of loyal supporters and Musk fans among its shareholders.Tesla, and Musk, have mounted a high-profile campaign to ensure they win. Last month the billionaire shared a glossy video on X, the social network formerly known as Twitter that he bought and renamed, which he claimed Tesla staff had made ""of their own volition"". It urged investors to ""protect Tesla"" by voting for the carmaker's proposals, warning that future growth was on the line.Musk has received support from some deep-pocketed backers. ""Without his relentless drive and uncompromising standards, there would be no Tesla,"" the billionaire investor Ron Baron said last week.That drive has earned the tycoon his fair share of critics. Trade unions are attempting to organise inside Tesla plants, claiming it is high time the company's workers were handed their fair share of its profits.He faces questions, too, over how he divides his time with the rest of his empire, which includes X; the rockets and satellites group SpaceX; Neuralink, a brain implant start-up; and the Boring Company, a tunnelling venture.""Tesla will ultimately be victorious in the narrative where, if it's not for Musk, we don't have the EV [electric vehicle] transformation globally that we've seen,"" said Ives. ""He deserves the pay package: he executed.""But it's at a time when Tesla is going through a difficult growth period. There's category 5 headwinds, and Musk has created a lot of noise and controversy, which has frustrated some investors.""Victory on Thursday is unlikely to end the saga.

"Robyn Denholm says electric carmaker's CEO could spend his time elsewhere if biggest pay deal in US corporate history isn't approvedBusiness live – latest updatesThe chair of Tesla has raised the prospect of Elon Musk stepping back from the electric carmaker if shareholders do not back the chief executive's $56bn (£44bn) pay package, saying there are ""other places"" the entrepreneur could spend his time.Robyn Denholm added in a letter to investors that next week's vote on the biggest remuneration deal in US corporate history was ""obviously not about the money"" because Musk would remain one of the richest people on the planet regardless of the outcome.Denholm said Musk could step away from Tesla, or spend less time at the company, if the vote on 13 June went against him. Investors approved Musk's original $56bn (£44bn) pay deal in 2018 but it was struck down by a judge in January, forcing the board to ask them to ratify it again.""What we recognised in 2018 and continue to recognise today is that one thing Elon most certainly does not have is unlimited time. Nor does he face any shortage of ideas and other places he can make an incredible difference in the world,"" Denholm wrote. ""We want those ideas, that energy and that time to be at Tesla, for the benefit of you, our owners. But that requires reciprocal respect.""Musk's other business interests include the rocket company SpaceX, artificial intelligence startup xAI and X, the social media platform. Some Tesla investors have expressed concern about his ability to focus on Tesla. Musk's behaviour on X, where he has more than 186 million followers, has also irritated one institutional investor in Tesla, Ross Gerber, who said it has ""absolutely damaged the [Tesla] brand"".Denholm wrote in the shareholder letter, dated 5 June, that the purpose of the 2018 deal was to ""keep Elon focused on Tesla and motivated to achieve the company's incomparable ambitions"".""Upholding our end of the bargain, then, by ratifying the decision we all made in 2018, is more important than ever. If Tesla is to retain Elon's attention and motivate him to continue to devote his time, energy, ambition and vision to deliver comparable results in the future, we must stand by our deal,"" she wrote.Referring to Musk's fortune, Denholm added: ""This is obviously not about the money. We all know Elon is one of the wealthiest people on the planet, and he would remain so even if Tesla were to renege on the commitment we made in 2018.""Denholm said the package, which included options to buy Tesla stock, requires Musk to wait five years before selling shares that he receives in the deal.Musk's fortune stands at $203bn, according to Bloomberg, making him the world's third wealthiest person.Last month, ISS, a top proxy advisory firm, recommended shareholders vote against the package, calling the compensation excessive. Glass Lewis, another advisory firm, has recommended a vote against. Bailie Gifford, a top-15 investor in Tesla, has said it plans to back the package, while Calpers, the US public pension fund and a top-25 shareholder, has said it plans to vote against.Musk owns approximately 13% of Tesla but the statement to shareholders before the AGM indicates that the billionaire's stake will not count towards the vote, saying the vote must be a majority of Tesla stock ""not owned, directly or indirectly, by Mr Musk"" or his brother Kimbal.Denholm also asked shareholders to approve moving the company's legal base to Texas. Tesla is incorporated in the US state of Delaware but Musk moved immediately to switch its registration to Texas, where its headquarters are based.""Being incorporated in Texas provides the best platform for Tesla to grow and innovate because we believe that Texas legislators and courts are in the best position to fairly develop and make decisions about corporate law that applies to Tesla, especially when our next big bet pays off beyond anyone's wildest expectations,"" wrote Denholm.Dan Ives, an analyst at the US stockbroker Wedbush Securities, said Musk was ""not going anywhere"" but could drop his chief executive title and become less involved in Tesla if the vote goes against him.""Musk is not going anywhere but if the comp package is denied he will potentially shed his CEO title and become less involved in Tesla over time,"" said Ives.Copyright (c) 2024 theguardian.com-NonSyndicated",2024-06-07,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240607:nNRAswkmrf:1,Tesla,governance

"SAN FRANCISCO Billionaire Elon Musk is offering tours of Tesla's factory in June to 15 shareholders who vote on his US$56 billion (S$75.5 billion) pay package, the latest effort by the electric vehicle maker to rally votes for the compensation after a court struck it down.The upcoming vote, whose result will be announced at the company's annual meeting on June 13, is seen as a referendum on Mr Musk's leadership as investors worry that he is distracted by his other ventures and that his often controversial comments are weighing on the reputation and sales of Tesla.The company is making an unusual and public effort to rally support for Mr Musk's pay. Its board has justified the pay deal by saying it is necessary to make sure Mr Musk prioritises Tesla over his other commitments.Tesla has asked shareholders to reaffirm their approval of the record-breaking compensation that was set in 2018 but was rejected by a judge who found the package was negotiated by directors who appeared beholden to Mr Musk.""Don't delay, vote today!"" Tesla said on May 28.Led by Mr Musk and other Tesla executives, the tour of the company's production lines for Cybertrucks and Model Ys in Texas will take place on June 12, the day before Tesla's annual shareholders' meeting, Tesla said on its website.The move is ""the last-ditch effort to try to charm retail investors"", said Ms Nell Minow, vice-chairwoman of ValueEdge Advisors, an advisory on corporate governance.According to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, 44 per cent of Tesla's common stock is held by non-professional shareholders including retail investors, the highest percentage of the 10 largest companies in the S&amp;P 500.""I think it just speaks to his grandiosity that he thinks that somehow being in his presence is going to have the results he wants. I don't think he's changing anybody's vote from doing this.""Proxy advisory company Glass Lewis said on May 25 that it had urged Tesla shareholders to reject the pay package, citing Mr Musk's ""slate of extraordinarily time-consuming projects"".""His focus is clearly not just on Tesla,"" said Ms Kristin Hull, founder of Tesla investor Nia Impact Capital, who voted against the pay package.The world's richest person, Mr Musk is also chief executive of SpaceX, acquired Twitter in 2022 and started AI company xAI, which raised US$6 billion in its latest funding.Mr Musk owns around 13 per cent of Tesla, and exercising his stock options would result in his owning 22 per cent of the company.He has threatened to build artificial intelligence products outside of Tesla if he cannot get 25 per cent voting power, which would require some of the stock options in the compensation deal.Building AI projects outside Tesla could hurt Tesla's valuation, which relies on its AI capability in self-driving technology.Mr Musk said that the world's most valuable carmaker would be ""worth basically zero"" without full self-driving capability.

"IndiaIndia, May 27 -- Tesla shareholders have been urged to reject a $56 billion pay package for company's CEO Elon Musk by proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis. If the pay package is passed, Elon Musk will have the largest pay package for a CEO in corporate America. The firm cited reasons like the ""excessive size"" of the pay deal, the dilutive effect upon exercise and the concentration of ownership for denying the pay package. It also said that Elon Musk's ""slate of extraordinarily time-consuming projects"" which increased after purchase of Twitter, now known as X, could be an impediment.While Tesla has urged shareholders to reaffirm their approval of the compensation, Tesla's board chair Robyn Denholm told the Financial Times that Elon Musk deserves the pay package as the company has achieved its ambitious targets.Elon Musk's pay package was proposed by Tesla's board of directors which has come under fire for its close ties with the billionaire. The package has no salary or cash bonus but sets rewards based on Tesla's market value rising to as much as $650 billion over the 10 years from 2018.This package was voided in January by Judge Kathaleen McCormick of Delaware's Court of Chancery after which Elon Musk sought to move Tesla's state of incorporation to Texas from Delaware.Elon Musk became Tesla CEO in 2008 and took the company to a $15 billion profit from a $2.2 billion loss in 2018, according to an online campaign website Vote Tesla.

"Tesla investors are urging shareholders to vote against Elon Musk's $56bn payday and have slammed the board for failing to curtail him.The group of shareholders calling for investors to push back includes New York City comptroller Brad Lander. He wrote to fellow Tesla investors on Monday asking them to refuse Mr Musk's pay package as well as the re-appointment of two board members, according to The Wall Street Journal.""Even as Tesla's performance is floundering, the board has yet to ensure that Tesla has a full-time CEO who is adequately focused on the long-term sustainable success of our company,"" the group wrote on Monday.""Tesla is suffering from a material governance failure which requires our urgent attention and action,"" they added.In the letter, the investors argue against the re-appointment of Kimball Musk, Mr Musk's brother, and James Murdoch, a personal friend, because of their close connection to Mr Musk. Kimball Musk has been on the board for two decades.Mr Lander argued that the board has been too close to Mr Musk and that they hadn't done their due diligence when assessing the pay package.Also part of the shareholder group critical of Mr Musk's compensation package are Amalgamated Bank, SOC Investment Group, Nordea Asset Management, United Church Funds, and Danish pension fund AkademikerPension. Mr Lander, a Democrat, is in charge of New York City's public pension funds.Shareholders are set to vote on Mr Musk's compensation and other issues, such as moving the firm's incorporation to Texas, at Tesla's annual meeting on 13 June. The compensation package received the green light from shareholders in 2018 but it was struck down in January by a court in Delaware, pointing to issues with the approval process. The judge was also concerned that it wasn't in the shareholders' best interest, Bloomberg noted.Tesla then proposed the compensation package yet again and has worked to convince shareholders to back it.The company has argued that Mr Musk earned the money by reaching targets set in 2018 when it comes to Tesla's share price and other matters.But a number of investors feel that the compensation package has raised questions regarding the independence of the board as well as Mr Musk's role atop Tesla amid rising competition and decreasing demand in the electric vehicle market.The group of shareholders critical of the pay package argues that the board of Tesla is filled with allies of Mr Musk and that it hasn't seriously held him accountable. Mr Musk is at the head of several companies that he splits his time between. The group also said Mr Musk's use of Tesla stock to fund other projects puts investors at risk.Mr Musk's buying of Twitter ""played a material role in Tesla's underperformance"", the group argued.Copyright (c) 2024 Independent.co.uk",2024-05-21,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240521:nNRAsqd5uo:1,Tesla,governance
"A group of Tesla shareholders are asking investors to vote against a compensation package worth more than $40 billion for CEO Elon Musk, saying that it's not in the electric vehicle maker's best interest.Tesla is struggling with falling global sales, slowing electric vehicle demand, an aging model lineup and a stock price that has tumbled 30% this year.The shareholder group, which includes New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, SOC Investment Group and Amalgamated Bank, said in a letter to shareholders that ratification of Musk's pay package would do nothing to promote Tesla's long-term growth and stability.There's also concern that approval of the pay package will potentially lead to lawsuits arguing that it is corporate waste. And Musk is viewed as a part-time CEO at Tesla, with his time increasingly being spent on other business commitments, the letter said.""Shareholders should not pretend that this award has any kind of incentivizing effect—it does not. What it does have is an excessiveness problem, which has been glaringly apparent from the start,"" the group said.They noted that if shareholders ratify the compensation package, it's possible that another plan will be put forth next year.""Given Tesla's history of exponentially larger awards, Musk may well ask for another award,"" the group said.The group is also asking investors to vote against the reelection of board members Kimbal Musk, Elon's brother, and James Murdoch, a former executive at media company Twenty-First Century Fox.Last month Tesla asked shareholders to restore Musk's pay package, which was valued at $56 billion at the time, that was rejected by a Delaware judge this year . At the time, it also asked to shift the company's corporate home to Texas.The changes will be voted on by stockholders at a June 13 annual meeting.In a letter to shareholders released in a regulatory filing last month, Chairperson Robyn Denholm said that Musk has delivered on the growth it was looking for at the automaker, with Tesla meeting all of the stock value and operational targets in the 2018 package that was approved by shareholders.

Investigators are exploring whether Tesla committed wire fraud,... The crown jewel of the Elon Musk collection of explodingproducts remains the Tesla electric vehicle . Not so much for the car itself, but as a financial vehicle that continues to inflate his net worth... even beyond what Delaware corporate law can countenance . While Musk still requires a social media babysitter — a condition of his settlement with the feds over past securities manipulation claims — thanks to the Supreme Court's refusal to get him out of the deal he signed , that may not be enough to save his company from another round of charges.Failing to get out of his own legal commitments? Seems like a trend .This time, it's all about Tesla's ""self-driving"" claims and whether its marketing claims went impermissibly far afield of reality for a car that still requires an alert human driving to jump in.In an exclusive story , Reuters reports that the federal government is mulling a variety of responses — up to and including securities and wire fraud charges — over the self-driving claims.U.S. regulators have separately investigated hundreds of crashes, including fatal ones, that have occurred in Teslas with Autopilot engaged, resulting in a mass recall by the automaker.Reuters exclusively reported the U.S. criminal investigation into Tesla in October 2022, and is now the first to report the specific criminal liability federal prosecutors are examining.Investigators are exploring whether Tesla committed wire fraud, which involves deception in interstate communications, by misleading consumers about its driver-assistance systems, the sources said. They are also examining whether Tesla committed securities fraud by deceiving investors, two of the sources said.Before Musk responds with ""I was on Wifi so it can't be wire fraud, checkmate n00bs"" or something equally as dazzling, it's worth noting that prosecutors have not settled on anything yet according to Reuters.To what extent did anyone rely on the autopilot claims when either purchasing or investing in Tesla? Its cachet as a car rests in its environmentally friendly traits and its cachet as a stock is... being a meme stock.But just how far is too far when it comes to puffery? Tesla has advertised its system as an ""autopilot"" despite being little more than a driver assistance program . Making it less of an ""autopilot"" than a ""computer willing to hold the wheel steady while you reach for the fry you dropped."" Tesla maintains that they've always seen autonomous driving as more of a long-term goal and failing to match the hype with reality doesn't make it fraud, much like Boeing markets its product as ""airworthy"" and by gum, they hope to get there someday.All thorny issues for prosecutors to hash out.

While Musk still requires a social media babysitter - a condition of his settlement with the feds over past securities manipulation claims - thanks to the Supreme Court's refusal to get him out of the deal he signed , that may not be enough to save his company from another round of charges.Failing to get out of his own legal commitments? Seems like a trend .This time, it's all about Tesla's ""self-driving"" claims and whether its marketing claims went impermissibly far afield of reality for a car that still requires an alert human driving to jump in.In an exclusive story , Reuters reports that the federal government is mulling a variety of responses - up to and including securities and wire fraud charges - over the self-driving claims.U.S. regulators have separately investigated hundreds of crashes, including fatal ones, that have occurred in Teslas with Autopilot engaged, resulting in a mass recall by the automaker.Reuters exclusively reported the U.S. criminal investigation into Tesla in October 2022, and is now the first to report the specific criminal liability federal prosecutors are examining.Investigators are exploring whether Tesla committed wire fraud, which involves deception in interstate communications, by misleading consumers about its driver-assistance systems, the sources said. They are also examining whether Tesla committed securities fraud by deceiving investors, two of the sources said.Before Musk responds with ""I was on Wifi so it can't be wire fraud, checkmate n00bs"" or something equally as dazzling, it's worth noting that prosecutors have not settled on anything yet according to Reuters.To what extent did anyone rely on the autopilot claims when either purchasing or investing in Tesla? Its cachet as a car rests in its environmentally friendly traits and its cachet as a stock is… being a meme stock.But just how far is too far when it comes to puffery? Tesla has advertised its system as an ""autopilot"" despite being little more than a driver assistance program . Making it less of an ""autopilot"" than a ""computer willing to hold the wheel steady while you reach for the fry you dropped."" Tesla maintains that they've always seen autonomous driving as more of a long-term goal and failing to match the hype with reality doesn't make it fraud, much like Boeing markets its product as ""airworthy"" and by gum, they hope to get there someday.All thorny issues for prosecutors to hash out. For now, all the rest of us can do is take a page from Tesla autopilot users and say, ""let's see where it goes from here.""Exclusive: In Tesla Autopilot probe, US prosecutors focus on securities, wire fraud [Reuters]Joe Patrice is a senior editor at Above the Law and co-host of Thinking Like A Lawyer .

Description: A global rout in tech stocks sent European markets down across the board, while quarterly results from Stellantis, Renault and Kering also disappointed. On Friday's calendar are Mercedes-Benz, BASF and NatWest.

Video Transcript:
European shares tumble amid a global tech stock rout. Welcome to your Europe Markets Briefing. I am Elena Casas. The STOXX 600 is set for its worst day in over three months. The tech sector sank after a sell-off in US mega caps triggered by poor results from Tesla. Big European names also reported disappointing numbers. Stellantis and Renault both lost over 8% on the back of weak quarterly results, while luxury goods giant Kering fell 7.6% after a bigger-than-expected drop in second-quarter sales. Companies in the Eurozone's two biggest economies are growing more pessimistic, business surveys showed today. In Germany, the Ifo Business Climate Index fell for a fourth straight month. While in France, manufacturers said demand from abroad was weakening and morale in the services sector hit its worst level in more than three years. As President Macron welcomes business leaders to Paris ahead of tomorrow's Olympics, travel firms and airlines have been complaining that tourists are staying away. One strategist told us earlier that the latest economic projections for the Eurozone could turn out to be too optimistic.
Question marks about global growth will prove to be problematic for the Eurozone. So, we have seen those forward-looking survey indicators retreating quite significantly. Expectations within the Ifo survey dipped below the current reading, and that is a rather negative backdrop. So, I think that does suggest that the Euro macroeconomic projections are going to be challenged.
Well, after a fall in Lloyds' profits got UK bank earnings off to a weak start this morning, NatWest is up on Friday. The Conservative government was planning a major public share sale to reduce its 21% stake, but Labour has yet to announce its own plans. Stated pre-tax profits is expected to have dropped to GBP5.1 billion, down by nearly a sixth as interest income falls. Also, up tomorrow is Mercedes-Benz, after weak numbers from Stellantis, Ford, and Nissan today raised fears of a wider slowdown across the car industry. Also reporting are chemicals giant BASF and cement manufacturer Holcim. And flights were halted at Frankfurt Airport this morning after six climate change activists blocked runways by gluing themselves to the tarmac. The protestors were part of a Europe-wide wave of action that also disrupted airports in Switzerland and Norway this morning. While seven Just Stop Oil members were arrested at Heathrow. And that is your Europe Markets Briefing.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

30km Awaruite Nickel Trend From Data Compilation at its Atlantic Nickel
Project in Central Newfoundland  - First Atlantic Nickel also announced it
has completed a large-scale data compilation for its 21,850-hectare
Atlantic Nickel Project in Central Newfoundland, Canada. This first-time
extensive review, covering the entire Pipestone Ophiolite Ultramafic
Complex, identified over 700 regional exploration reports. Of these, 134
contained relevant project information, including data on prospecting,
geological mapping, airborne geophysics, geochemistry, and drilling.

     The data compilation program outlined a 30-km core trend with
consistent, highly anomalous nickel concentrations, strongly correlating
with the Pipestone Complex's high-magnetic ultramafic rocks. These rocks
have high potential for hosting awaruite (nickel-iron alloy) nickel
deposits, positioning the project to become the first major awaruite nickel

30km Awaruite Nickel Trend From Data Compilation at its Atlantic Nickel
Project in Central Newfoundland  - First Atlantic Nickel also announced it
has completed a large-scale data compilation for its 21,850-hectare
Atlantic Nickel Project in Central Newfoundland, Canada. This first-time
extensive review, covering the entire Pipestone Ophiolite Ultramafic
Complex, identified over 700 regional exploration reports. Of these, 134
contained relevant project information, including data on prospecting,
geological mapping, airborne geophysics, geochemistry, and drilling.

     The data compilation program outlined a 30-km core trend with
consistent, highly anomalous nickel concentrations, strongly correlating
with the Pipestone Complex's high-magnetic ultramafic rocks. These rocks
have high potential for hosting awaruite (nickel-iron alloy) nickel
deposits, positioning the project to become the first major awaruite nickel
exploration and development project in Atlantic Canada.   CONTINUED Read

Atlantic Nickel Project in Central Newfoundland, Canada. This first-time
extensive review, covering the entire Pipestone Ophiolite Ultramafic
Complex, identified over 700 regional exploration reports. Of these, 134
contained relevant project information, including data on prospecting,
geological mapping, airborne geophysics, geochemistry, and drilling.

     The data compilation program outlined a 30-km core trend with
consistent, highly anomalous nickel concentrations, strongly correlating
with the Pipestone Complex's high-magnetic ultramafic rocks. These rocks
have high potential for hosting awaruite (nickel-iron alloy) nickel
deposits, positioning the project to become the first major awaruite nickel
exploration and development project in Atlantic Canada.   CONTINUED Read

TESLA INC (""TSLA-Q"")
UNITED STATES STEEL CORP (""X-N"")
POWER NICKEL INC (""PNPN-V"")
- Global Nickel Mining Market Expected to Reach $94 Billion By
- 2033 as Demand Surges

     FN Media Group News Commentary - The nickel mining market is fueling
several international industries that require nickel to continue to expand.
Experts see sustained growth in the global nickel mining market. A report
from Precedence Research said that the global nickel mining market size,
which surpassed USD 50.07 billion in 2023, is projected to be worth around
USD 94.43 billion by 2033, expanding at a CAGR of 6.60% from 2024 to 2033.
The report said: The surge in electric vehicle (EV) production and
renewable energy projects further propels the demand for nickel, a crucial
component in batteries and clean energy technologies. With expanding
economies, strategic investments in mining infrastructure, and a burgeoning
urbanization trend, Asia-Pacific remains a key player, driving substantial
growth and influencing the dynamics of the global nickel mining market. The
rapid expansion of the electric vehicle (EV) market stands as a pivotal
catalyst, driving a surge in nickel demand. Nickel's indispensable role in
electric vehicle batteries positions it as a cornerstone element in this
burgeoning market. It said key takeaways were: Asia-Pacific contributed
more than 58% of market share in 2023; North America is estimated to expand
the fastest CAGR between 2024 and 2033; By end-use, the non-ferrous alloys
segment has held the largest market share of 46% in 2023; By end-use, the
batteries segment is anticipated to grow at a remarkable CAGR of 7.8%
between 2024 and 2033; By mining technique, the open cast mining segment
generated over 56% of market share in 2023; and By mining technique, the
underground mining segment is expected to expand at the fastest CAGR over
the projected period.   Active companies in the markets this week include:
First Atlantic Nickel Corp. (OTCQB: FANCF) (TSXV: FAN), FMC Corporation
(NYSE: FMC), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), Power Nickel Inc. (OTCQB: PNPNF)
(TSX-V: PNPN), United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X).

     Precedence Research concluded: The Asia Pacific nickel mining market
size was valued at USD 29.04 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach
around USD 55.80 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 6.80% from 2024 to
2033. Asia-Pacific held a dominating share of 58% in the nickel mining
market due to a combination of factors. Asia-Pacific commands a significant
share in the nickel mining market due to robust industrialization,
infrastructure development, and the region's pivotal role in the global
stainless steel sector. North America is set for swift expansion in the
nickel mining market owing to a heightened need for nickel in electric
vehicle (EV) manufacturing and renewable energy applications. The region's
commitment to clean energy initiatives and carbon reduction fuels the
demand for nickel, essential in EV battery production. Supported by
favorable government policies, investments in sustainable mining methods,
and advancements in mining technologies, North America stands as a pivotal
player in the growing nickel mining sector on the global stage.

would like to learn about a potential recovery, CLICK HERE
(https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/JgDRKtDa2X).The lawsuit has been filed against Toyota on behalf of purchasers of Toyota
securities between June 23, 2022 and June 2, 2024, inclusive (the ""Class
Period"").The deadline for investors who purchased or acquired Toyota securities during
the Class Period to seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of
the class, is August 23, 2024.Toyota is a Japanese car manufacturer.According to the lawsuit, on June 3, 2024, the New York Times published an
article entitled ""Toyota and Other Japanese Carmakers Say They Mishandled
Safety Tests."" This article stated that ""Toyota . . . and other top Japanese
automakers said on Monday that internal investigations found they had
mishandled vehicle testing on dozens of models over the past decade."" Further,
""Toyota said it had failed to gather proper data when doing pedestrian and
occupant safety tests for three models, including its popular Yaris Cross
sport utility vehicle.""On this news, Toyota's American Depositary Shares (""ADSs"") fell $5.34 per ADS,

investor or small group of investors who have the largest financial interest
and who are also adequate and typical of the proposed class of investors. The
lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class
and these attorneys, if approved by the court, are lead or class counsel. Your
ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision
whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. Communicating with any counsel is
not necessary to participate or share in any recovery achieved in this case.
Any member of the purported class may move the Court to serve as a lead
plaintiff through counsel of his/her choice, or may choose to do nothing and
remain an inactive class member.Berger Montague (https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/QOJz1h2zbP), with

occupant safety tests for three models, including its popular Yaris Cross

leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims
against Toyota Motor Corporation (""Toyota"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: TM) and
reminds investors of the August 23, 2024 deadline to seek the role of lead
plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the

York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of
millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See
www.faruqilaw.com.As detailed below, this Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period,
Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as
failed to disclose material adverse facts, about the Company's business and
operations. Specifically, Defendants misrepresented and/or failed to disclose
that: (1) Toyota understated its malfeasance relating to certification of its
cars and issues relating to overall legal compliance; and (2) as a result,
defendants' statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were
materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all
relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims
that investors suffered damages.On June 3, 2024, The New York Times published an article entitled ""Toyota and
Other Japanese Carmakers Say They Mishandled Safety Tests."" This article
stated, in pertinent part, that ""Toyota . . . and other top Japanese
automakers said on Monday that internal investigations found they had
mishandled vehicle testing on dozens of models over the past decade."" Further,
""Toyota said it had failed to gather proper data when doing pedestrian and
occupant safety tests for three models, including its popular Yaris Cross
sport utility vehicle.""On this news, Toyota's American Depositary Shares (""ADSs"") fell $5.34 per ADS,
or 2.45%, to close at $212.17 per ADS on June 3, 2024.The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial
interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of
class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the
putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve
as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing

"New York, New York--(Newsfile Corp. - July 26, 2024) - WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a
global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Toyota
Motor Corporation (NYSE: TM) between June 23, 2022 and June 2, 2024, both
dates inclusive (the ""Class Period""), of the important August 23, 2024 lead
plaintiff deadline in the securities class action first filed by the Firm.SO WHAT: If you purchased Toyota securities during the Class Period you may be
entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs
through a contingency fee arrangement.WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Toyota class action, go to
https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/... or call Phillip Kim, Esq.

class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to
serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than August 23,
2024. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other
class members in directing the litigation.WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track
record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not
have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition.
Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are
merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually
litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm
represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in
securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm
has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a
Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class
Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The
firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered
hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured
over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was
named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys
have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class
Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to
disclose that: (1) Toyota understated its malfeasance relating to
certification of its cars and issues relating to overall legal compliance; and
(2) as a result, defendants' statements about its business, operations, and
prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable
basis at all times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit
claims that investors suffered damages.To join the Toyota class action, go to
https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/... or call Phillip Kim, Esq.
toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the
class action.No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not
represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your
choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this
point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not
dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.Follow us for updates on LinkedIn:

"Since it invaded Ukraine, Russia has faced increasing sanctions from its foreign trade partners, particularly the US and Europe. Recent data reveals that this downturn continued in June, with Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia experiencing slumps of -26% YoY, -12% YoY, and -4% YoY, respectively, during the month. Since these countries have together accounted for... Highlights you may have missedSince it invaded Ukraine, Russia has faced increasing sanctions from its foreign trade partners, particularly the US and Europe. Following the recent announcement of the US Treasury expanding its secondary sanctions programme, international pressure looks set to rachet up even further. However, the Russian economy seems to have broadly adapted to the new geopolitical environment and has seen signs of some recovery. In the Light Vehicle (LV) market, sales volumes are well on the way to recovery - after a near 60% drop in annual registrations in 2022, GlobalData estimates registrations to have grown by as much as 53% in 2023. The latest estimates for the Russian LV market show that new vehicle sales exceeded 675k units in the first half of 2024 - this constitutes a 78% improvement on the same period last year, an impressive figure compared to somewhat subdued results elsewhere in Europe. While some of this can be attributed to growth in GDP and domestic demand, this result indicates that the LV market has begun to adapt to the sanctions placed on Russia. We do not expect the market to grow as rapidly throughout the year, however, as much of this growth stems from a recovery from the low base of 2023.ASEAN fallingIn May, ASEAN Light Vehicle (LV) sales dropped by 5% YoY, marking the 10th consecutive month of declines. Recent data reveals that this downturn continued in June, with Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia experiencing slumps of -26% YoY, -12% YoY, and -4% YoY, respectively, during the month. Since these countries have together accounted for 73% of ASEAN LV sales this year, the overall ASEAN market is estimated to have dropped by 9.4% in June and 8.6% YoY in H1 2024.Volvo and tariffsQuestions about EU tariffs took centre stage during Volvo Cars' Q2 2024 results call, with president and CEO Jim Rowan giving reassurances that ""it's a short-term issue."" Particularly affected is the firm's China-made fully electric SUV the EX30, which the firm announced would have its production moved to Ghent, Belgium. ""We're going to start to see the impact of that [tariffs] in the second half of this year,"" Mr Rowan said. He did not give any clues as to whether pricing would change for the vehicle following the tariffs, instead adding that the firm was ""in a strong position"" and is ""looking at all the options available."" Asked whether Volvo could quantify the expected impact of the tariffs, CFO Johan Ekdahl said that it ""is an ongoing dialogue [with the EU Commission]. We don't know the final outcome - which is important to emphasise.""GM brand futureHow will GM manage diverging IC versus EV preferences in the US and China as it plans next generation Buicks and Cadillacs? two main own brands plus the three-way JV of SAIC-GM-Wuling make up the majority of the American OEM's sales in the giant Chinese market. Buick has been the company's own volume play for some years, with Cadillac also more successful in the PRC than it has been in the US. GM remains committed to an electric future in China - and eventually, North America too - but has to decide if it will continue making major investments in both EVs and gasoline-powered models. Some would say it has no choice but so far, the firm has held back on matching the bargain basement pricing of new electric and electrified models from multiple rival brands in China. And for that reason, Buick, Cadillac and Chevrolet sales have taken a major hit. This report looks at how General Motors might decide to proceed, highlighting certain cars, minivans/MPVs and SUVs. The most likely strategy appears to be a pullback (for now) on going all-in with EVs for Cadillac, instead offering hybrid/plug-in hybrid alternatives not only in North America but China too.Harris worriesWith president Joe Biden stepping down from the presidential race and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, the future of US climate policy - and its impact on the motor finance sector - could undergo significant transformation. Harris, known for her stance on climate issues and regulatory actions, could drive the US towards more stringent environmental standards and innovative financial mechanisms for the automotive industry. As vice president, Harris was instrumental in promoting the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the largest climate spending law in US history. The IRA aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 42% below 2005 levels by 2030, with significant implications for the automotive sector. The legislation's focus on clean energy and electric vehicle (EV) incentives aligns with the motor finance industry's growing shift towards sustainable investments and green financing options.Silicon boostCould a different approach to battery design address key barriers to broader EV adoption? Leading international developer and manufacturer of advanced silicon anode materials for lithium-ion batteries, Nexeon, has developed battery materials that it says enable a significantly higher cell energy density. Higher density allows for the design of smaller and more cost-effective batteries which, in turn, leads to enhanced performance for several applications, including EVs where range and charging times can be improved. We spoke to Scott Brown, CEO, Nexeon, to learn more about the battery technologies the company is working on and the benefits they can potentially bring to EVs.Disability challengesOne in five people in the UK live with a disability. It is predicted that the number of disabled disabled drivers, or passengers, in Britain could rise to 2.7 million by 2035. Alongside government regulations for the ending the sales of new ICE-only vehicles by 2035, these drivers will increasingly transition to EVs. However, disabled EV drivers face a number of additional challenges such as non-accessible charge points, difficulty in making payments, the inability to add ramps to vehicles and more. To assist with these pain-points, Motability Operations, the company that runs the life-changing Motability Scheme in the UK, has launched 'Go Charge', billed as a solution to simplify public EV charging for its customers. Partnering with tech company, Paua, 'Go Charge' provides a free app and card that streamlines the process of finding and paying for EV charging. It covers more than 70% of all rapid charge points across the UK. We spoke to head of innovation, Motability Operations, Jon Jenkins, to hear more about the assistance offered to disabled EV drivers, and the challenges they face.Split, money backRenault UK has promised prospective buyers of its Scenic E-Tech EV it is such the perfect family car to bring an end to in-car friction and offered money back if a couple splits up after buying one. There are, of course Ts &amp; Cs.Battery pactPowerCo, Volkswagen Group's battery firm, and QuantumScape have announced they have entered into an agreement to industrialise QuantumScape's next-generation solid-state lithium-metal battery technology. Upon satisfactory technical progress and certain royalty payments, QuantumScape will grant PowerCo the license to mass produce battery cells based on QuantumScape's technology platform. Under the non-exclusive license, PowerCo can manufacture up to 40 gigawatt-hours (GWh) per year using QuantumScape's technology with the option to expand up to 80 GWh annually, enough to outfit approximately one million vehicles per year.Its Q2 timeFord second quarter 2024 revenue was up 6% year on year to US$47.8bn on ""a slight increase in wholesales"". Net income was $1.8bn and adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, was $2.8bn with Ford, without provding comparisons, saying: ""Profitability was affected by an increase in warranty reserves, though efforts to lift the quality of new products are starting to pay off."" Ford Pro's second quarter EBIT was $2.6 billion, an increase of 7% and a margin of 15%. Segment revenue was $17bn, up 9% and three times the rate of growth in product shipments during the period.Hybrid partsToyota West Virginia has started production of the fifth generation hybrid transaxle. Assembly is a result of a US$300m investment at the plant announced in 2021 and 2022. The latest hybrid transaxle is used for Camry and Corolla Cross models made in the US. Since 2021, Toyota has announced new investment of $18.6bn into its US manufacturing operations to support electrification.Nissan disasterNissan posted quarterly operating profit barely in the black at just 1 billion yen for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. That compares with 128.6 billion yen posted for the same quarter last year. Revenues in the quarter were up 80.7 billion yen to 2,998.5 billion yen, the drop in profitability down to soft prices, model mix and heavy use of incentives in the US market. Nissan lowered its operating profit forecast for this fiscal year to 500 billion yen (previous forecast 600 billion yen).Stellantis weakStellantis has posted a set of disappointing financial results for the first half of the year as its brands struggled with product portfolio gaps, soft prices and swollen inventory. ""The company's performance in the first half of 2024 fell short of our expectations, reflecting both a challenging industry context as well as our own operational issues,"" said Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares. At ?85.0 billion, first half net revenues were down 14% y-o-y, while net profit at ?5.6 billion was down 48% on year-ago levels.Truck batteriesDaimler Truck has opened its Battery Technology Center (BTC) at the firm's plant in Mannheim, Germany. The facility measures 10,000 square metres, with cells to be produced here on a pilot basis in order to build up process knowledge. Additionally, battery packs will be manufactured as prototypes for test benches and test vehicles. With the pilot line for battery packs, the Mannheim site is preparing for future series production, planned for the second half of the decade as part of the introduction of the next generation of lithium-ion batteries at the plant.China closingHonda said this week it planned to close a vehicle assembly plant in China and suspend production at another, to step up its transition to zero emission vehicles. The move is part of a broader review of the company's global operations with the automaker having already announced earlier this month plans to consolidate vehicle production at one of its two assembly plants in Thailand from 2025 due to overcapacity. Honda has struggled in China with falling demand for internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles with local new energy vehicle (NEV) manufacturers behind much of the moderate domestic market growth in the last two years.UK plungeUK car production fell 7.6% in the first six months of the year, according to figures published by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). UK factories turned out 416,074 units, 34,094 fewer than in the same period in 2023, following a 26.6% decline in June caused by multiple model changes. The SMMT said the performance was expected as manufacturers retool lines to make electrified models following some £23.7 billion of UK investment announced last year.Have a nice weekend.Graeme Roberts, Deputy Editor, Just AutoCopyright © 2024 MarketLine",2024-07-26,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240726:nNRAtd9jbo:1,Toyota,esg

When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.On June 3, 2024, The New York Times published an article entitled “Toyota and Other Japanese Carmakers Say They Mishandled Safety Tests.” This article stated, in pertinent part, that “Toyota [. . .] and other top Japanese automakers said on Monday that internal investigations found they had mishandled vehicle testing on dozens of models over the past decade.” Further, “Toyota said it had failed to gather proper data when doing pedestrian and occupant safety tests for three models, including its popular Yaris Cross sport utility vehicle.”On this news, Toyota’s American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) fell $5.34 per ADS, or 2.45%, to close at $212.17 per ADS on June 3, 2024.The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.  Faruqi &amp; Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Toyota’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.To learn more about the Toyota class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/TM or call Faruqi &amp; Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).Follow us for updates on LinkedIn, on X, or on Facebook.Attorney Advertising.

"New York, New York--(Newsfile Corp. - July 25, 2024) - WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a
global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Toyota
Motor Corporation (NYSE: TM) between June 23, 2022 and June 2, 2024, both
dates inclusive (the ""Class Period""), of the important August 23, 2024 lead
plaintiff deadline in the securities class action first filed by the Firm.SO WHAT: If you purchased Toyota securities during the Class Period you may be
entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs
through a contingency fee arrangement.WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Toyota class action, go to
https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/... or call Phillip Kim, Esq.
toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the
class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to
serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than August 23,
2024. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other
class members in directing the litigation.WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track
record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not
have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition.
Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are
merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually
litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm
represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in
securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm
has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a
Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class
Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The
firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered
hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured
over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was
named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys
have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class
Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to
disclose that: (1) Toyota understated its malfeasance relating to
certification of its cars and issues relating to overall legal compliance; and
(2) as a result, defendants' statements about its business, operations, and
prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable
basis at all times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit
claims that investors suffered damages.To join the Toyota class action, go to
https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/... or call Phillip Kim, Esq.
toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the
class action.No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not
represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your
choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this
point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not
dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.Follow us for updates on LinkedIn:

(https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/bVDOYSOPO0)A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class
members in directing the litigation. The lead plaintiff is usually the
investor or small group of investors who have the largest financial interest
and who are also adequate and typical of the proposed class of investors. The
lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class
and these attorneys, if approved by the court, are lead or class counsel. Your
ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision
whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. Communicating with any counsel is
not necessary to participate or share in any recovery achieved in this case.
Any member of the purported class may move the Court to serve as a lead
plaintiff through counsel of his/her choice, or may choose to do nothing and
remain an inactive class member.Berger Montague, with offices in Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Delaware,

"NEW YORK, July  23, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE: TM) between June 23, 2022 and June 2, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important August 23, 2024 lead plaintiff deadline in the securities class action first filed by the Firm.SO WHAT: If you purchased Toyota securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Toyota class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=25663 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than August 23, 2024. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases.  Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Toyota understated its malfeasance relating to certification of its cars and issues relating to overall legal compliance; and (2) as a result, defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.To join the Toyota class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=25663 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.Follow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm or on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm.Attorney Advertising.

     [Click here for information about joining the class action]

     On June 3, 2024, Toyota filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission an English translation of an announcement that Toyota filed with
the Tokyo Stock Exchange earlier that day. Toyotas announcement said that
after investigat[ing] its model certification applications as per
instructions from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and
Tourism (MLIT), Toyota discovered that seven models . . . were tested using
methods that differed from the government standards[.] That same day, The
New York Times published an article entitled Toyota and Other Japanese
Carmakers Say They Mishandled Safety Tests. The article reported that
Toyota [. . .] and other top Japanese automakers [acknowledged] that
internal investigations found they had mishandled vehicle testing on dozens
of models over the past decade. Further, Toyota said it had failed to
gather proper data when doing pedestrian and occupant safety tests for
three models, including its popular Yaris Cross sport utility vehicle.

     On this news, Toyotas American depositary share (ADS) price fell $5.34
per ADS, or 2.45%, to close at $212.17 per ADS on June 3, 2024.

     Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London,
Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the
areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by
the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar,
Pomerantz pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than

fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. The Firm has recovered billions
of dollars in damages awards on behalf of class members. See

"ROSEN, A GLOBAL AND LEADING LAW FIRM, Encourages Toyota Motor Corporation Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action First Filed by the Firm TMTOYOTA MOTOR CORP (""TM-N"")
- ROSEN, A GLOBAL AND LEADING LAW FIRM, Encourages Toyota Motor
- Corporation Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important
- Deadline in Securities Class Action First Filed by the Firm - TM

     WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds
purchasers of securities of Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE: TM) between
June 23, 2022 and June 2, 2024, both dates inclusive (the Class Period), of
the important August 23, 2024 lead plaintiff deadline in the securities
class action first filed by the Firm.

     SO WHAT: If you purchased Toyota securities during the Class Period
you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket
fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.

     WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Toyota class action, go to
https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=25663 or call Phillip Kim, Esq.
toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on
the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you
wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than
August 23, 2024. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on
behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.

     WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with
a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices
do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer
recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class
actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law
firms that actually litigate the cases.  Be wise in selecting counsel. The
Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its
practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation.
Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action
settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by
ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action
settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since
2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In
2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020,
founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of
Plaintiffs Bar. Many of the firms attorneys have been recognized by
Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.

     DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout
the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or
failed to disclose that: (1) Toyota understated its malfeasance relating to
certification of its cars and issues relating to overall legal compliance;
and (2) as a result, defendants statements about its business, operations,
and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a
reasonable basis at all times. When the true details entered the market,
the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

     To join the Toyota class action, go to
https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=25663 or call Phillip Kim, Esq.
toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on
the class action.

     No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not
represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of
your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at
this point. An investors ability to share in any potential future recovery
is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than August 23, 2024. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition.

Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Toyota understated its malfeasance relating to certification of its cars and issues relating to overall legal compliance; and (2) as a result, defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.To join the Toyota class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=25663 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point.

"Since it invaded Ukraine, Russia has faced increasing sanctions from its foreign trade partners, particularly the US and Europe. Recent data reveals that this downturn continued in June, with Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia experiencing slumps of -26% YoY, -12% YoY, and -4% YoY, respectively, during the month. Since these countries have together accounted for... Highlights you may have missedSince it invaded Ukraine, Russia has faced increasing sanctions from its foreign trade partners, particularly the US and Europe. Following the recent announcement of the US Treasury expanding its secondary sanctions programme, international pressure looks set to rachet up even further. However, the Russian economy seems to have broadly adapted to the new geopolitical environment and has seen signs of some recovery. In the Light Vehicle (LV) market, sales volumes are well on the way to recovery - after a near 60% drop in annual registrations in 2022, GlobalData estimates registrations to have grown by as much as 53% in 2023. The latest estimates for the Russian LV market show that new vehicle sales exceeded 675k units in the first half of 2024 - this constitutes a 78% improvement on the same period last year, an impressive figure compared to somewhat subdued results elsewhere in Europe. While some of this can be attributed to growth in GDP and domestic demand, this result indicates that the LV market has begun to adapt to the sanctions placed on Russia. We do not expect the market to grow as rapidly throughout the year, however, as much of this growth stems from a recovery from the low base of 2023.ASEAN fallingIn May, ASEAN Light Vehicle (LV) sales dropped by 5% YoY, marking the 10th consecutive month of declines. Recent data reveals that this downturn continued in June, with Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia experiencing slumps of -26% YoY, -12% YoY, and -4% YoY, respectively, during the month. Since these countries have together accounted for 73% of ASEAN LV sales this year, the overall ASEAN market is estimated to have dropped by 9.4% in June and 8.6% YoY in H1 2024.Volvo and tariffsQuestions about EU tariffs took centre stage during Volvo Cars' Q2 2024 results call, with president and CEO Jim Rowan giving reassurances that ""it's a short-term issue."" Particularly affected is the firm's China-made fully electric SUV the EX30, which the firm announced would have its production moved to Ghent, Belgium. ""We're going to start to see the impact of that [tariffs] in the second half of this year,"" Mr Rowan said. He did not give any clues as to whether pricing would change for the vehicle following the tariffs, instead adding that the firm was ""in a strong position"" and is ""looking at all the options available."" Asked whether Volvo could quantify the expected impact of the tariffs, CFO Johan Ekdahl said that it ""is an ongoing dialogue [with the EU Commission]. We don't know the final outcome - which is important to emphasise.""GM brand futureHow will GM manage diverging IC versus EV preferences in the US and China as it plans next generation Buicks and Cadillacs? two main own brands plus the three-way JV of SAIC-GM-Wuling make up the majority of the American OEM's sales in the giant Chinese market. Buick has been the company's own volume play for some years, with Cadillac also more successful in the PRC than it has been in the US. GM remains committed to an electric future in China - and eventually, North America too - but has to decide if it will continue making major investments in both EVs and gasoline-powered models. Some would say it has no choice but so far, the firm has held back on matching the bargain basement pricing of new electric and electrified models from multiple rival brands in China. And for that reason, Buick, Cadillac and Chevrolet sales have taken a major hit. This report looks at how General Motors might decide to proceed, highlighting certain cars, minivans/MPVs and SUVs. The most likely strategy appears to be a pullback (for now) on going all-in with EVs for Cadillac, instead offering hybrid/plug-in hybrid alternatives not only in North America but China too.Harris worriesWith president Joe Biden stepping down from the presidential race and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, the future of US climate policy - and its impact on the motor finance sector - could undergo significant transformation. Harris, known for her stance on climate issues and regulatory actions, could drive the US towards more stringent environmental standards and innovative financial mechanisms for the automotive industry. As vice president, Harris was instrumental in promoting the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the largest climate spending law in US history. The IRA aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 42% below 2005 levels by 2030, with significant implications for the automotive sector. The legislation's focus on clean energy and electric vehicle (EV) incentives aligns with the motor finance industry's growing shift towards sustainable investments and green financing options.Silicon boostCould a different approach to battery design address key barriers to broader EV adoption? Leading international developer and manufacturer of advanced silicon anode materials for lithium-ion batteries, Nexeon, has developed battery materials that it says enable a significantly higher cell energy density. Higher density allows for the design of smaller and more cost-effective batteries which, in turn, leads to enhanced performance for several applications, including EVs where range and charging times can be improved. We spoke to Scott Brown, CEO, Nexeon, to learn more about the battery technologies the company is working on and the benefits they can potentially bring to EVs.Disability challengesOne in five people in the UK live with a disability. It is predicted that the number of disabled disabled drivers, or passengers, in Britain could rise to 2.7 million by 2035. Alongside government regulations for the ending the sales of new ICE-only vehicles by 2035, these drivers will increasingly transition to EVs. However, disabled EV drivers face a number of additional challenges such as non-accessible charge points, difficulty in making payments, the inability to add ramps to vehicles and more. To assist with these pain-points, Motability Operations, the company that runs the life-changing Motability Scheme in the UK, has launched 'Go Charge', billed as a solution to simplify public EV charging for its customers. Partnering with tech company, Paua, 'Go Charge' provides a free app and card that streamlines the process of finding and paying for EV charging. It covers more than 70% of all rapid charge points across the UK. We spoke to head of innovation, Motability Operations, Jon Jenkins, to hear more about the assistance offered to disabled EV drivers, and the challenges they face.Split, money backRenault UK has promised prospective buyers of its Scenic E-Tech EV it is such the perfect family car to bring an end to in-car friction and offered money back if a couple splits up after buying one. There are, of course Ts &amp; Cs.Battery pactPowerCo, Volkswagen Group's battery firm, and QuantumScape have announced they have entered into an agreement to industrialise QuantumScape's next-generation solid-state lithium-metal battery technology. Upon satisfactory technical progress and certain royalty payments, QuantumScape will grant PowerCo the license to mass produce battery cells based on QuantumScape's technology platform. Under the non-exclusive license, PowerCo can manufacture up to 40 gigawatt-hours (GWh) per year using QuantumScape's technology with the option to expand up to 80 GWh annually, enough to outfit approximately one million vehicles per year.Its Q2 timeFord second quarter 2024 revenue was up 6% year on year to US$47.8bn on ""a slight increase in wholesales"". Net income was $1.8bn and adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, was $2.8bn with Ford, without provding comparisons, saying: ""Profitability was affected by an increase in warranty reserves, though efforts to lift the quality of new products are starting to pay off."" Ford Pro's second quarter EBIT was $2.6 billion, an increase of 7% and a margin of 15%. Segment revenue was $17bn, up 9% and three times the rate of growth in product shipments during the period.Hybrid partsToyota West Virginia has started production of the fifth generation hybrid transaxle. Assembly is a result of a US$300m investment at the plant announced in 2021 and 2022. The latest hybrid transaxle is used for Camry and Corolla Cross models made in the US. Since 2021, Toyota has announced new investment of $18.6bn into its US manufacturing operations to support electrification.Nissan disasterNissan posted quarterly operating profit barely in the black at just 1 billion yen for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. That compares with 128.6 billion yen posted for the same quarter last year. Revenues in the quarter were up 80.7 billion yen to 2,998.5 billion yen, the drop in profitability down to soft prices, model mix and heavy use of incentives in the US market. Nissan lowered its operating profit forecast for this fiscal year to 500 billion yen (previous forecast 600 billion yen).Stellantis weakStellantis has posted a set of disappointing financial results for the first half of the year as its brands struggled with product portfolio gaps, soft prices and swollen inventory. ""The company's performance in the first half of 2024 fell short of our expectations, reflecting both a challenging industry context as well as our own operational issues,"" said Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares.

"TOYOTA MOTOR CORP (""TM-N;TOMA-F"")
- Driving Decarbonization in America - To Air on MotorTrend
- TV, Discovery Go and Discovery+ Streaming

 The unmistakable futuristic hum from passing vehicles on the road signals
a new era in transportation and mobility. The automotive industry is
transforming with new ownership models, cutting-edge connectivity, and
innovative advanced electrified powertrains.

 But with change, comes questions: why are automakers focusing so much on
electrified powertrains? What does this shift, marked by the futuristic
hum, really mean for consumers, and is this transformation really
necessary?

 At the core, it comes down to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. CO2 is
essential to life on earth, but too much poses a threat. When in balance,
CO2 helps keep planet Earth warm enough to sustain life; however, an
imbalance can lead to a much warmer average temperature, which can lead to
bringing forward the predicted results of climate change.

 But where does this excess CO2 come from? Natural sources make up the
majority of CO2 released into the atmosphere: Oceans, animal and plant
respiration, organic matter decomposition, forest fires, and emissions from
volcanic eruptions.

 Another contributor to CO2 emissions is human activity, including power
generation, industrial sources, chemical production, agricultural
practices, and transportation. Of all sectors, transportation accounts for
the largest percentage of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the United
States, coming in at 28%. Between 1990 and 2021r, GHG emissions within the
transportation sector, including carbon dioxide, increased more than any
other human-based activity. Science has shown that CO2 is a contributing
factor to climate change, and, as such, efforts by governments, companies,
and individuals to reduce or eliminate CO2 emissions are gaining momentum.
After all, CO2 emissions can remain in the atmosphere for hundreds of
years, and the impact of emissions in one region can be felt globally.

 As automobile tailpipes are prevalently visible by so many people each
day, transportation, especially the automotive industry, has become a focal
point. Fortunately, various solutions are being deployed: regulations,
incentives, innovative products, technologies, and services are converging
to combat CO2.

 To explore these critical topics, a compelling three-part video series,
Driving Decarbonization in America, has been produced by Bader Media Group,
funded by Toyota. Hosted by Ross Butler with field reporting from Neka Zang
and Ariana Cohen, the series immerses viewers in the world of CO2 emissions
and what is being done in the automotive industry. Examining what carbon
dioxide and greenhouse gases are, the series delves into the relentless
drive to reduce or eliminate CO2 from new vehicles. By exploring the
various vehicle types, powertrains, and technologies that have shaped  and
continue to shape  the industry landscape, viewers are taken on a dynamic
journey that spans past, present, and future innovations in sustainable
mobility.

 Providing a rare glimpse into the automakers' perspective, the series'
hosts speak with the world's largest manufacturer, Toyota, providing an
in-depth look at their multi-pathway approach to vehicles and technology,
alongside other companies dedicated todriving decarbonization.

 The series will airon MotorTrend TV with availability on the DISCOVERY GO
App and DISCOVERY+ Streaming.The world premiere of the episodes will be:

 In the series, viewers will learn:

 From Subject Matter Experts:

 The series will provide viewers with valuable knowledge shared by
industryanalysts, researchers, engineers, thinktanks, and company
executives. These experts will discuss the significance of carbon dioxide
emissions and how combined efforts are driving decarbonization.

 Vehicle Electrification:

 A portfolio of low- and zero-emission vehicles are currently available and
are helping reduce CO2 emissions today. Hybrid, plug-in hybrid, fuel cell
and battery electric vehicles will be discussed, shedding light on how
choices can help consumers find a way to reduce their carbon dioxide
emissions.

 Automotive Batteries:

 The push towards electrification means more automotive batteries. While
having more battery electric vehicles on the road may mean less
tailpipe-emissions, what about other sources of emissions? Are we just
shifting CO2 emissions from the tailpipe to somewhere else? Innovations in
battery recycling and ways to optimize supply chain logistics will be key
to this growing area.

 Existing Vehicles:

 There is a significant emphasis on new vehicles and their emissions, but
what about the vehicles that are not electrified? Even with the most
optimistic projections indicating that 50% or more of new vehicle sales in
the United States will be battery electric by 2032, the fact remains that a
large portion of vehicles on the road will still have internal combustion
engines, meaning they may still emit carbon dioxide. If reducing carbon is
so important and a priority, is there a solution that can help reduce CO2
emissions from these and other legacy vehicles?

 Utility/energy systems:

 Electric vehicles also bring with them the possibility of bidirectional
charging, where electricity can be taken off the grid to charge the
batteries, but also flow the other way. But when is the best time to
charge, and is the electricity being used coming from renewable energy
sources? How can vehicles become a tool for utility companies to help make
the overall energy grid more resilient?

 Join us as we follow Ross' journey as he explores the increasingly
important topics of the future of transportation and CO2 emissions through
this three-part series this summer.

"The transport ministry has concluded that six cases of misconduct by Toyota Motor Corp. related to vehicle certification may violate not only domestic standards but also U.N. vehicle regulations, it has been learned.The U.N. vehicle regulations are international safety and environmental standards that have been adopted by 62 countries and regions including Japan, South Korea and Europe. Given that Japan's domestic regulations for cars accord with those of the United Nations, the irregularities are highly likely to result in manufacturers being barred from mass-producing the vehicles involved in the scandal in Europe and elsewhere.Monday marked one week since the Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism Ministry announced five vehicle manufacturers had engaged in misconduct over model certification - a requirement for the mass production of automobiles and motorcycles. The ministry will use the results of on-site inspections conducted at each company to consider administrative action based on the Road Transport Vehicle Law. According to the ministry, because Japan has adopted the U.N. vehicle regulations, any vehicle manufacturer that obtains model certification in Japan is automatically eligible for the same certification in 61 countries and regions, including the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and South Korea, without completing additional certification tests at each location. This procedure - called mutual recognition -- helps reduce the burden on manufacturers operating overseas.Irregularities were found in six tests at Toyota, including the following: (1) offset frontal collision tests, which evaluate the degree of passenger protection; (2) pedestrian head and leg protection performance tests; (3) rear collision tests; and (4) engine power tests. These tests are also included in the U.N. vehicle regulations, which means they violate them as well.While Toyota claims that it conducted some tests under stricter conditions than the national requirement, the ministry concluded that was not necessarily the case.Concerning pedestrian protection tests aimed at measuring the impact to the head of a pedestrian hit by a car, Toyota said at a press conference on June 3 that the company had used its development test data, which utilizes an impact angle of 65 degrees rather than the required 50 degrees. While the company apologized and said it should have conducted the test once more with an impact angle of 50 degrees, it claimed that 65 degrees was a stricter test.However, according to sources close to the government, the strictness of a safety test depends on such factors as the shape of the car's hood; the difference in the angle alone is not a determining factor. Toyota also claimed that other tests were conducted under stricter conditions than required. However, the government believes it is impossible to say whether that was true in all cases. Instead, it is highly likely that Europe and other regions will consider Toyota's misconduct to be a violation of regulations.In the wake of the scandal, some manufacturers have called on the government to streamline the system of vehicle certification itself to ensure international competitiveness and for other reasons. However, the transport ministry is highly concerned that reducing domestic standards that accord with those of the United Nations will lead to a loss of mutual recognition for domestic manufacturers, which would adversely affect their overseas operations.The five companies, Toyota, Mazda Motor Corp., Yamaha Motor Co., Honda Motor Co. and Suzuki Motor Corp., insist that the 38 models involved in the scandal meet domestic standards and that people can continue to drive them without a problem. However, the transport ministry plans to perform its own tests on these models. The discovery of a deviation from government standards may trigger a recall in and outside Japan.",2024-06-11,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240611:nNRAsxvjik:1,Toyota,environment

"Vehicle manufacturer Toyota is set to end its massive sponsorship deal with the International Olympic Committee after this year's Paris Olympics, according to reports in Japan.Toyota has a contract through the 2024 Paris Games, which was reported to be valued at $835 million when it was announced in 2015. It included four Olympics beginning with the Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Games in South Korea and ran through Paris.It has been widely reported to be the IOC's largest sponsorship deal.Citing ""sources close to the matter,"" Japanese news agency Kyodo said Toyota was unhappy the way sponsorship money was used by the IOC. The news agency, quoting the sources, said the money was ""not used effectively to support athletes and promote sports.""Reached by the Associated Press, Toyota declined to comment and said financial details were private.Toyota pulled its Olympic advertising in Japan during the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Games in 2021. It said it was responding to strong public sentiment in the country against staging the Olympics and the IOC's push to hold them.The IOC did not comment on the reports when contacted by AP.""We have an agreement with Toyota until the Olympic Games Paris 2024,"" the IOC said. ""We continue to work closely together in preparation for Paris and we look forward to bringing these plans to life.""Toyota is supplying 3,000 fuel-cell vehicles for the Paris Games to show off its green technology.The IOC generates 91% of its income from selling broadcast rights (61%) and sponsorships (30%).The IOC had income of $7.6 billion in the last four-year cycle ending with the Tokyo Games. The IOC's 15 so-called TOP sponsors paid over $2 billion in that period. The figure is expected to reach $3 billion in the next cycle.""There's no sports property that touches as many bases as the Olympics in truly every country,"" Rick Burton, who teaches sports marketing at Syracuse University, told Associated Press. ""You have high brand recognition. You just don't have other sports properties that gives you that.""Burton said the IOC was likely to find another vehicle brand if Toyota bows out. He said the best look would be finding a replacement quickly.In addition to Toyota, the TOP sponsors are: ABInBev, Airbnb, Alibaba, Allianz, Atos, Bridgestone, Coca-Cola, Deloitte, Intel, Omega, Panasonic, P&amp;G, Samsung, and Visa.Japan officially spent $13 billion on the Tokyo Olympics, at least half of which was public money. A government audit suggested the real cost was twice that. The IOC contribution was about $1.8 billion.The Tokyo Games were mired in corruption scandals linked to local sponsorships and the awarding of contracts. Dentsu Inc, the huge Japanese marketing and public-relations company, was the marketing arm of the Tokyo Olympics and raised a record-$3.3 billion in local sponsorship money. This is separate from TOP sponsors.French prosecutors also looked into alleged vote-buying in the IOC's decision in 2013 to pick Tokyo as the host for the Olympics.Copyright (c) 2024 Independent.co.uk",2024-06-04,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240527:nNRAssgnnb:16,Toyota,environment

Toyota Motor Corporation, Subaru Corporation and Mazda Motor Corporation have agreed to collaborate in the development of ""new engines tailored to electrification and the pursuit of carbon neutrality"".The automakers confirmed in a joint statement ""with these engines, each of the three companies will aim to optimize integration with motors, batteries and other electric drive units. While transforming vehicle packaging with more compact engines, these efforts will also decarbonize internal combustion engines (ICE) by making them compatible with various carbon-neutral fuels"", which it describes as fuels with net zero CO2 emissions across their lifecycles - from manufacture to usage. These include e-fuels such as liquid hydrogen, synthetic fuels and biofuels derived from biomass.The three automakers said they ""have been always been driven by a deep understanding of their customers' diverse lifestyles, which they say has led them to develop signature engines such as Subaru's horizontally-opposed engine, Toyota's inline-four engine and Mazda's rotary engine.With this latest collaboration the partners aim to develop next generation engines that not only improve standalone engine performance but also optimize their integration within electrified powertrains. This will allow them to develop more compact powertrains, which will help them improve overall vehicle design including aerodynamic performance.Toyota's CEO Koji Sato confirmed in a statement ""in order to provide our customers with diverse options to achieve carbon neutrality, it is necessary to take on the challenge of evolving engines that are in tune with the energy environment of the future. The three companies, which share the same aspirations, will refine engine technologies through friendly competition"".Subaru's CEO Atsushi Osaki said ""achieving a carbon-neutral society is a challenge that must be undertaken by all of Japan's industries and society as a whole. As we continue to refine electrification technology, we will also enhance our horizontally-opposed engines with an aim to use carbon-neutral fuels in the future. Moving forward, the three companies sharing the same aspiration will continue to advance the pursuit of sustainable excellence in Japanese car manufacturing"".Mazda's CEO Masahiro Moro added ""we will continue to offer customers exciting cars by honing internal combustion engines for the electrification era and expanding the multi-pathway possibilities for achieving carbon neutrality.

"TOKYO (AP) — ""An engine reborn.""That's how Japanese automaker Toyota introduced plans to cast a futuristic spin on the traditional internal combustion engine.During a three-hour presentation at a Tokyo hall Tuesday, the car manufacturer giant announced it would offer lean compact engines that also run on so-called green fuels like hydrogen and bioethanol, or get paired with zero-emissions electric motors in hybrids.This comes as many competitors in the auto industry are pushing for fully electric vehicles. China is revving its push for Battery Electric Vehicles , and its own BYD is threatening to outshine Tesla in that push.Toyota's Chief Executive Koji Sato said the ""engine is optimized for the electrification era"" with hopes of helping push the world into ""carbon neutrality.""Toyota already has a well-known hybrid car — the Prius — with a gas engine and an electric motor. It switches between the two to deliver a cleaner drive.In future hybrids, the electric motor is set to become the main driving power, and the new engine will be designed to take a lesser role and help it along, according to Toyota.Domestic allies Subaru Corp. and Mazda Motor Corp. , both preparing ecological engines designed to meet the inevitably upcoming stringent emissions standards, joined Toyota 's presentation billed as a ""multi-pathway workshop.""""Each company wants to win, but we can be faster if we work together,"" said Sato.But details on when the engines were coming to market weren't disclosed.The legacy of the car engine could be felt everywhere.Mazda said that its prized rotary engine, introduced more than 50 years ago, was being adapted for electric vehicles.Subaru, meanwhile, showcased its trademark smaller horizontally opposed engine. While Chief Technology Officer Tetsuro Fujinuki confirmed the company was working on a great ""Subaru-like"" electric vehicle, he said the company wasn't about to dump the engine altogether.Toyota, too, is working on stylish BEVs .The executives said Tuesday that energy supply conditions differed globally, adding that products had to meet various customer needs and the investments needed for mass-producing BEVS were enormous.Toyota officials also repeatedly noted that 5.5 million jobs were at stake in the overall supply chain for vehicle production in Japan nowadays, so a sudden shift to electric cars wasn't economically possible or socially responsible.Takahiro Fujimoto, a professor of business at Waseda University, believes electric vehicles are a key solution for reducing emissions. But they still have weak points, such as large amounts of emissions produced while making lithium-ion batteries, a chief component.In Japan, for instance, commuters use trains, so that may be a better ecological choice for transportation, Fujimoto said.""At the very least, I believe the proliferation of and innovations in BEVs are definitely needed. But that argument is logically not the same as saying that all we need are BEVs,"" he said.Uncertainties remain, spanning research and development, as well as social, political and market conditions, said Fujimoto.""The carbon neutrality the world is aspiring toward isn't likely attainable for decades to come. It's going to be a long marathon race,"" he said.___Yuri Kageyama is on X: https://twitter.com/yurikageyamaCopyright © 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

"Toyota City, Japan, May 27, 2024 - (JCN Newswire) - Idemitsu Kosan Co., Ltd. (""Idemitsu Kosan""), ENEOS Corporation (""ENEOS""), Toyota Motor Corporation (""Toyota""), and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (""MHI"") announce that they have commenced a study toward the introduction and spread of carbon-neutral fuels that contribute to the decarbonization of automobiles with the aim of realizing a carbon-neutral society. Seeking to introduce carbon-neutral fuels in Japan around 2030, the four companies fulfilling major roles respectively in supply, technology, and demand will jointly embark on this study.About carbon-neutral fuelsCarbon-neutral fuels are fuels that limit CO2 emissions across the entire product life cycle. It is a collective term that includes synthetic fuels (e-fuel) made using hydrogen and CO2, and biofuels made from raw materials such as plants that absorb CO2 via photosynthesis. Liquid carbon-neutral fuels in particular are advantageous in terms of energy storage and transportation and are suitable as energy sources that can be transported.Scope of joint study by the four companiesDiscuss and study scenarios and roadmaps for the introduction of carbon-neutral fuels in Japan's automobile market and the various systems necessary for market introduction
Investigate the feasibility of production from perspectives such as energy security in Japan""Shaping Change"" is Idemitsu Kosan's Vision for 2050, and based on this vision, it is working on the social implementation of a steady supply of diverse, eco-friendly ""Energy one step ahead"" that forms one of the three business domains stated in its Medium-term Management Plan. As part of this effort, it is seeking the early introduction and spread of carbon-neutral fuels―synthetic fuels and biofuels―while collaborating with various companies within and outside Japan.ENEOS stated in its Group's Long-Term Vision that it will take on the challenge of achieving both a stable supply of energy and materials and the realization of a carbon-neutral society. It is undertaking various initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including using hydrogen and renewable energy and carrying out business development of carbon-neutral fuels such as synthetic fuels.Centered on a multi-pathway approach, Toyota is working toward carbon neutrality not just through the spread of electrified vehicles, but also by reducing the CO2 emissions of internal combustion engine vehicles. In 2007, it introduced flex-fuel vehicles (vehicles that can run on both biofuels and gasoline) in Brazil. Going forward, it will continue to work on reducing the CO2 emissions of internal combustion engine vehicles, including existing vehicles, and will also consider the development of engines specifically designed for electrified vehicles that contribute to the spread of carbon-neutral fuels.MHI Group has made our 2040 carbon neutrality declaration ""MISSION NET ZERO"" and is actively working to build a CO2 solutions ecosystem and a hydrogen solutions ecosystem. Through MHI group products, technologies, and services that help reduce CO2 emissions, as well as new solutions and innovations to be developed with partners around the world, we will contribute to realizing a carbon neutral society.Collaboration and partnership across industries are essential for the spread of carbon-neutral fuels toward the realization of a carbon-neutral society. As the first step in this direction, Idemitsu Kosan, ENEOS, Toyota and MHI will collaborate to undertake a study toward the introduction and spread of carbon-neutral fuels.Source: Toyota Motor CorporationCopyright 2024 JCN Newswire .

- FuelCell Energy and Toyota Motor North America Celebrate
- Launch of World's First 'Tri-gen' Production System at the
- Port of Long Beach

//st

  * FuelCell Energy's Tri-gen technology produces three products: renewable
electricity, renewable hydrogen, and usable water

  * Marks Toyota's first port vehicle processing facility in the world to
be powered by onsite-generated, 100 percent renewable electricity

  * Both light-duty and Class 8 heavy-duty fuel cell electric vehicles have
been fueled using Tri-gen generated renewable hydrogen

//et

     FuelCell Energy, Inc. and Toyota Motor North America, Inc. (Toyota)are
celebrating the grand opening ofthe first-of-its-kind ""Tri-gen"" systemat
the Port of Long Beach, California, today. Tri-gen uses biogas to produce
renewable electricity, renewable hydrogen, and usable water, and was built
to support the vehicle processing and distribution center for Toyota
Logistics Services (TLS) at Long Beach, Toyota's largest North American
vehicle processing facility that receives approximately 200,000 new Toyota
and Lexus vehicles annually.

     ""The goal of our collaboration with FuelCell Energy was to find
sustainable solutions for the TLS vehicle processing facility here at the
Port of Long Beach as part of our goal to remove carbon dioxide emissions
from our operations,"" said Group Vice President of Sustainability and
Regulatory Affairs at Toyota, Tom Stricker. ""This groundbreaking facility
shows that there are ways to reduce our emissions and burden on natural
resources with scalable technology based on hydrogen.""

     Thanks to FuelCell Energy's Tri-gen platform, TLS Long Beach is
Toyota's first port vehicle processing facility powered by 100 percent
on-site generated renewable electricity. FuelCell Energy's innovative fuel
cell technology uses an electrochemical process that converts directed
renewable biogas into electricity, hydrogen, and usable water with a highly
efficient, combustion-free process that emits virtually no air pollutants.

     ""Tri-gen demonstrates that hydrogen-based energy can benefit
businesses, deliver zero-emission transportation for light- and heavy-duty
vehicles, support improved air quality in local communities, reduce water
usage, and deliver immediate and long-term benefits to the environment,""
FuelCell Energy CEO and President Jason Few said. ""As a company, we are
living our purpose when we enable visionary customers like Toyota to
decarbonize their operations and harness the energy solutions offered by
hydrogenall while leaving communities with cleaner air and easing the
strain on power grids and water supplies.""

     Tri-gen produces 2.3-megawatts of renewable electricity, part of which
will be utilized by TLS Long Beach to support its operations at the port.
Excess electricity is delivered to the local utility, Southern California
Edison, under the California Bioenergy Market Adjustment Tariff (BioMAT)
program, adding a renewable, resilient, and affordable baseload electric
generation resource to the electric grid.

     Tri-gen can also produce up to 1,200 kg/day of hydrogen for the
fueling needs of Toyota's incoming light-duty fuel cell electric vehicle
(FCEV) Mirai while also supplying hydrogen to the adjacent heavy-duty
hydrogen refueling station to support TLS logistics and drayage operations
at the port. As of January 1, 2024, California's Advanced Clean Fleet
Regulation will only allow zero-emission trucks to newly register as
drayage trucks. By 2035, all drayage trucks will be required to be
zero-emission. The Tri-gen platform supports FCEV Class 8 trucks today and
is there to support on-going migration to zero emission trucks between now
and 2035. Hydrogen production can be ramped up and down based on
demand.Since completing construction last year, in January of this year
Toyota used the renewable hydrogen produced at Tri-gen to fill the first
Toyota Mirai vehicles at TLS, and in April the first heavy-duty FCEV
Kenworth T680 Class 8 truck was filled at the adjacent Shell HD filling
station using Tri-gen-produced renewable hydrogen.

     The water byproduct of hydrogen generation can produce up to 1,400
gallons of usable water per day, which is being repurposed for TLScar wash
operations for vehicles that come into port before customer delivery. This
helps reduce the demand on the constrained local water supplies by
approximately half a million gallons per year.

     Supporting Port of Long Beach Initiatives

     By supporting TLS operations at the Port of Long Beach, Tri-gen is
expected to help reduce more than 9,000 tons of CO emissions from the power
grid each year. This supports both Toyota Logistics Services' carbon
reduction goals as well as the Port of Long Beach's goals as a leader in
innovative solutions to reducing carbon emissions.

     ""The dawn of the renewable hydrogen era is upon us, thanks to our
collaboration with Toyota andFuelCell Energy and their innovative Tri-gen
system,"" said Port of Long Beach CEO Mario Cordero. ""The green power
generated by the Tri-gen system, and similar projects, is part of our
multi-layered strategy to fuel our goal to become the world's first
zero-emissions Port.""

     Tri-gen will also help avoid more than six tons of grid NOx emissions,
which are harmful to both people and the environment today. Using
hydrogen-powered fuel cell Class 8 trucks in port operations has the
potential to reduce diesel consumption by more than 420,000 gallons per
year.

     ""FuelCell Energy and Toyota's collaborative effort signifies
technological innovation and also positions Long Beach at the forefront of
global leadership in renewable energy solutions,"" said Long Beach Mayor
Rex Richardson. ""This transformative initiative solidifies our city's
status as a trailblazer in green initiatives and shows our dedication to a
cleaner, more sustainable future for our community and beyond.""

     Reaffirming its commitment to support fuel cell and additional
hydrogen-related products and technology toward a hydrogen economy, Toyota
Motor North America (TMNA) today announced that it is renaming the TMNA R&amp;D
California office as its new North American Hydrogen Headquarters (H2HQ).
The office workspace at the new H2HQ was recently redesigned for its teams
working from research and development to commercialization planning and
sales of hydrogen-related products and technologies. There are plans to add
key features to the H2HQ campus in the future such as a flexible microgrid,
sustainable customer education center and more.

     ""Toyota has developed hydrogen fuel cell electric solutions for more
than three decades, and we will continue to advance this scalable,
zero-emission technology as part of our electrified portfolio,"" said Ted
Ogawa, President and CEO, Toyota Motor North America. ""Renaming this
facility as North American Hydrogen Headquarters represents our leadership
in fuel cell development creating real-world products to help reduce carbon
emissions.""

     Last year, Toyota Motor Corporationreorganized its hydrogen business
in Japan to create what it calls ""Hydrogen Factory"" with the idea to bring
all hydrogen-related work under one location and accelerate
customer-oriented product development and production in fuel cell or
hydrogen-related products. Then, Toyota Motor Europeannounced its own
""Hydrogen Factory"" with the aim to further grow Toyota's hydrogen business
and stimulate wider roll-out of hydrogen ecosystems and infrastructure
across Europe.

     H2HQ will drive North American-led hydrogen initiatives and support
the localization of global hydrogen-related technologies and products that
include light-duty fuel cell applications, heavy-duty fuel cell
opportunities, stationary fuel cell power generation, port vehicle
applications and more. The facility already provides impressive research
and development assets, including Toyota's largest dynamometer (1.2 MW), a
scalable test bench for stationary applications, and a hydrogen fueling
station capable of providing fuel for both light- and heavy-duty vehicles.
Moreover, as part of its plans to remain and grow fuel cell leadership, NA
H2HQ will be home to several new projects in the coming years.

     ""I'm very pleased that Toyota is building on its longstanding
commitment to California by locating its North American hydrogen
headquarters here in the Golden State,"" said California State Senator,
District 29, Josh Newman. ""The work done there, along with green hydrogen
initiatives throughout the state, is propelling California toward a
dynamic, clean-energy economy which will also reduce carbon emissions and
foster environmental stewardship while extending California's leadership in
this important space.""

     Construction has begun on a flexible microgrid that features energy
sources available today, including a 230-kW solar photovoltaic system, a
1-MW stationary proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell generator, 325-kW
solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), and an onsite 500-kWh battery energy storage
system. The microgrid is designed to support the campus' energy needs,
allowing it the ability to operate off-grid. The system is expected to be
fully operational by 2026.

     ""California has ambitious goals to achieve clean air, carbon
neutrality and a vibrant economy. Toyota's investment to expand their
research and development of hydrogen fuel cell technology in our state is
an example of the innovation that will accelerate the development and
deployment of zero-emissions transportation options, particularly as we
decarbonize the goods movement sector,"" said CARB Chair Liane Randolph.

     In the future, Toyota's plans for the new North American Hydrogen HQ
will include a sustainable education center, available for tours by
reservation. The center will be a place for people to learn more about
Toyota's vision of sustainability and the role that hydrogen will play.

     30+ Years of Development

     From creating one of the world's first mass market passenger fuel cell
electric vehicles in theMirai, to applying and scaling the technology now
to other applications that can benefit from zero-emissions,
includingheavy-duty transport,power generation systems,and others, Toyota's
research and development with hydrogen fuel cell technology spans more than
30 years.

     For much of that time, the Gardena office supported or initiated a
wide range of fuel cell electric projects. To share some recent examples,
the Fuel Cell Development (FCD) team was instrumental in supporting the
development of Toyota's light-duty Mirai, launched back in 2015, and the
team collaborated with industry partners to help support infrastructure
growth through the state of California.

     In 2017, to address decarbonization efforts at local ports, Toyota's
FCD team helped prove the scalability of fuel cell technology after it
acquired a Class 8 truck and fitted it with a fuel cell electric powertrain
consisting of two Mirai fuel-cell stacks. This effort then led to a
collaboration with PACCAR's Kenworth brand to build 10 proof-of-concept
trucks, trucks used to support the ""Shore to Store"" ZANZEFF project that
proved the viability of hydrogen-powered fuel cells as a zero-emission
powertrain in heavy-duty applications. PACCAR and Toyota later agreed in
2023 to pursue commercialization of the project, with Toyota supplying the
fuel cell powertrain kits from its Kentucky plant as a Tier 1 supplier.

     Most recently, Toyota has demonstrated a non-automotive opportunity
for hydrogen-powered fuel cell technology in stationary power generation.
Toyota and TRD partnered to build a stationary unit to provide electricity
at events where it was not readily available, launching the first public
activation at an LPGA Tour stop where the unit supported the power needs of
the event stage and sound system. The solution provided clean, quiet power
that was proven to capably replace traditional diesel generators. Last
year, Toyota built a 1MW fuel cell electric generator for the National
Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado to support microgrid testing at the
facility. And finally, earlier this year, Toyota collaborated with Kohler
on a prototype stationary generator to provide backup emergency power for
Klickitat Valley Health hospital in Goldendale, Washington.

".storyContent span.prnews_span.storyContent li.prnews_li.storyContent p.prnews_pPR NewswireGARDENA, Calif., May 1, 2024H2HQ teams to lead NA region's efforts to research, develop, commercialize and sell fuel cell and hydrogen-related productsRenovated facility provides a refreshed office workspace, with plans to add features in the future, including a flexible microgrid, customer education center and moreGARDENA, Calif., May 1, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Reaffirming its commitment to support fuel cell and additional hydrogen-related products and technology toward a hydrogen economy, Toyota Motor North America (TMNA) today announced that it is renaming the TMNA R&amp;D California office as its new North American Hydrogen Headquarters (H2HQ). The office workspace at the new H2HQ was recently redesigned for its teams working from research and development to commercialization planning and sales of hydrogen-related products and technologies. There are plans to add key features to the H2HQ campus in the future such as a flexible microgrid, sustainable customer education center and more.""Toyota has developed hydrogen fuel cell electric solutions for more than three decades, and we will continue to advance this scalable, zero-emission technology as part of our electrified portfolio,"" said Ted Ogawa, President and CEO, Toyota Motor North America. ""Renaming this facility as North American Hydrogen Headquarters represents our leadership in fuel cell development creating real-world products to help reduce carbon emissions.""Last year, Toyota Motor Corporation reorganized its hydrogen business in Japan to create what it calls ""Hydrogen Factory"" with the idea to bring all hydrogen-related work under one location and accelerate customer-oriented product development and production in fuel cell or hydrogen-related products. Then, Toyota Motor Europe announced its own ""Hydrogen Factory"" with the aim to further grow Toyota's hydrogen business and stimulate wider roll-out of hydrogen ecosystems and infrastructure across Europe.  H2HQ will drive North American-led hydrogen initiatives and support the localization of global hydrogen-related technologies and products that include light-duty fuel cell applications, heavy-duty fuel cell opportunities, stationary fuel cell power generation, port vehicle applications and more. The facility already provides impressive research and development assets, including Toyota's largest dynamometer (1.2 MW), a scalable test bench for stationary applications, and a hydrogen fueling station capable of providing fuel for both light- and heavy-duty vehicles. Moreover, as part of its plans to remain and grow fuel cell leadership, NA H2HQ will be home to several new projects in the coming years.  ""I'm very pleased that Toyota is building on its longstanding commitment to California by locating its North American hydrogen headquarters here in the Golden State,"" said California State Senator, District 29, Josh Newman. ""The work done there, along with green hydrogen initiatives throughout the state, is propelling California toward a dynamic, clean-energy economy which will also reduce carbon emissions and foster environmental stewardship while extending California's leadership in this important space.""Construction has begun on a flexible microgrid that features energy sources available today, including a 230-kW solar photovoltaic system, a 1-MW stationary proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell generator, 325-kW solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), and an onsite 500-kWh battery energy storage system. The microgrid is designed to support the campus' energy needs, allowing it the ability to operate off-grid. The system is expected to be fully operational by 2026.""California has ambitious goals to achieve clean air, carbon neutrality and a vibrant economy. Toyota's investment to expand their research and development of hydrogen fuel cell technology in our state is an example of the innovation that will accelerate the development and deployment of zero-emissions transportation options, particularly as we decarbonize the goods movement sector,"" said CARB Chair Liane Randolph.In the future, Toyota's plans for the new North American Hydrogen HQ will include a sustainable education center, available for tours by reservation. The center will be a place for people to learn more about Toyota's vision of sustainability and the role that hydrogen will play.30+ Years of DevelopmentFrom creating one of the world's first mass market passenger fuel cell electric vehicles in the Mirai, to applying and scaling the technology now to other applications that can benefit from zero-emissions, including heavy-duty transport, power generation systems, and others, Toyota's research and development with hydrogen fuel cell technology spans more than 30 years.For much of that time, the Gardena office supported or initiated a wide range of fuel cell electric projects. To share some recent examples, the Fuel Cell Development (FCD) team was instrumental in supporting the development of Toyota's light-duty Mirai, launched back in 2015, and the team collaborated with industry partners to help support infrastructure growth through the state of California.In 2017, to address decarbonization efforts at local ports, Toyota's FCD team helped prove the scalability of fuel cell technology after it acquired a Class 8 truck and fitted it with a fuel cell electric powertrain consisting of two Mirai fuel-cell stacks. This effort then led to a collaboration with PACCAR's Kenworth brand to build 10 proof-of-concept trucks, trucks used to support the ""Shore to Store"" ZANZEFF project that proved the viability of hydrogen-powered fuel cells as a zero-emission powertrain in heavy-duty applications. PACCAR and Toyota later agreed in 2023 to pursue commercialization of the project, with Toyota supplying the fuel cell powertrain kits from its Kentucky plant as a Tier 1 supplier.Most recently, Toyota has demonstrated a non-automotive opportunity for hydrogen-powered fuel cell technology in stationary power generation. Toyota and TRD partnered to build a stationary unit to provide electricity at events where it was not readily available, launching the first public activation at an LPGA Tour stop where the unit supported the power needs of the event stage and sound system. The solution provided clean, quiet power that was proven to capably replace traditional diesel generators. Last year, Toyota built a 1MW fuel cell electric generator for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado to support microgrid testing at the facility. And finally, earlier this year, Toyota collaborated with Kohler on a prototype stationary generator to provide backup emergency power for Klickitat Valley Health hospital in Goldendale, Washington.About ToyotaToyota (NYSE:TM) has been a part of the cultural fabric in North America for more than 65 years, and is committed to advancing sustainable, next-generation mobility through our Toyota and Lexus brands, plus our more than 1,800 dealerships.Toyota directly employs more than 63,000 people in North America who have contributed to the design, engineering, and assembly of nearly 47 million cars and trucks at our 13 manufacturing plants. By 2025, Toyota's 14th plant in North Carolina will begin to manufacture automotive batteries for electrified vehicles. With more electrified vehicles on the road than any other automaker, Toyota currently offers 27 electrified options.For more information about Toyota, visit www.ToyotaNewsroom.com.Media ContactJoshua BurnsJoshua.Burns@Toyota.com  View original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/toyota-establishes-hydrogen-headquarters-to-accelerate-advancement-of-fuel-cell-technology-302132596.htmlSOURCE  Toyota Motor North AmericaCopyright (c) 2024 PR Newswire Association,LLC.

Description: Nissan is cutting output amid waning demand in the U.S., according to Reuters sources, while separate reports say it's beefing up domestic partnerships, with Mitsubishi Motors in talks to join its alliance with Honda. Julian Satterthwaite reports.

Video Transcript:
Nissan looks to be facing a deepening problem in the US. Reuters sources say it cut output by a third at its top Japanese plant this month as it struggles with demand. Among other things, that will slash production of its Rogue crossover. The sources say it will now make around 10,000 of the cars for export, or about half what it had previously planned. There was no comment from the company, but the report comes just days after Nissan said its profits were almost completely wiped out over the April to June quarter. It's been forced to do big discounts to win sales in the US, amid criticism over an aging lineup of models and weak demand for its electric cars. The company also doesn't offer hybrids in the American market, meaning it's missing out on the boom for such vehicles. Though Nissan has promised a wave of new model launches, analysts say its target of boosting sales by 1 million cars per year looks in doubt. Separately, Monday, media reports said Mitsubishi Motors is in talks to join Nissan's alliance with local rival Honda. Analysts say that underscores the pressure on automakers to work together to develop zero-emission vehicles and other technologies. A three-way alliance would range Nissan's team against that led by Toyota, which partners with Suzuki, Subaru and Mazda. There was no immediate comment from any of the companies involved.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as
failed to disclose material adverse facts, about the Company's business and
operations. Specifically, Defendants misrepresented and/or failed to disclose
that: (1) Toyota understated its malfeasance relating to certification of its

"Kaizer Chiefs coach Nasreddine Nabi said he learnt a lot from their pre-season friendly against Young Africans and asked the supporters to not take the 4-0 loss in the Toyota Cup to heart.MIHLALI BALEKANasreddine Nabi has urged the Kaizer Chiefs faithful not to read too much into their defeat to Young Africans yesterday, saying that it was a learning curve.Chiefs were hammered 4-0 by Yanga in the inaugural pre-season Toyota Cup at a sold-out Toyota Stadium in Bloemfontein. And while this was a friendly, some Chiefs supporters were already bemoaning the early decision to bet on Nabi to end the club's nine-year run without a trophy.But, speaking deep in the bowels of the 2010 World Cup stadium, the Tunisian reminded the Chiefs faithful that they are in a pre-season and rebuilding phase.""It's a friendly game, please guys!"" the Chiefs coach said. ""For the people that know football, a friendly game is not important (in terms of results).""Okay, I don't want a losing mentality ... The game today helped me a lot as the first fixture. It gave me the opportunity to know the level of my players, collectively and individually.""I am happy with the opportunity to see what I saw. I am not happy to lose any game, even at training. I am a winner by character.""If I had won today, and people started praising me 'Nabi, Nabi'. And then the league starts, and boom, (we lose) ... today we observed some positive points.""It's not my problem if people don't know football, and they don't sleep today because the team lost. I know which negatives, projectives and positives we saw today.""Nabi had also asked the Chiefs supporters to be less emotional and be patient in his pre-match media conferences.That request was justified yesterday as his side were put to the sword by the Tanzanians. Yanga capitalised on Chiefs' schoolboy errors with two easy goals in either half.Prince Dube opened the scoring for Yanga before Stephane Aziz Ki fired in on the stroke of half-time, followed by Clement Mzizi and Ki's goals in the second stanza.The loss stung for Nabi and his charges who had come into this match hoping for a bright start to their new dawn after a three-week camp in Türkiye and launch of their new jersey last week.""It was unpleasant for us, especially given the fact that we are playing at home,"" said Nabi, ""but we are taking everything that happened as a learning curve.""Nabi and his charges will aim to take positives and learn from their weakness going into another pre-season camp in Botswana before the start of the Betway Premiership on September 10.After all, Nabi had promised that while he might have brought an all-foreign technical team, he wants to try to rediscover the team's DNA.His technical team showed their commitment as they lined up on the touchline with their leader either to cajole the team or challenge referee Abongile Tom's decisions during the game.Yanga, however, proved why they were one of the best teams on the continent last season after finishing in the CAF Champions League quarter-finals.They had a free run in the engine room midway through the first half and early in the second half, before exploiting Chiefs' defensive frailties. Most of those mistakes came from their youngsters, but Nabi was a father figure, encouraging his troops with every error or substitution in the second half.In the end, Chiefs were given a reality check regarding their readiness to reclaim the glory days.Cape Times © 1999 - 2022 Independent Newspapers (Pty) Limited.

"However, Amakhosi will have to give their fans a snippet of their preparations under the Tunisian tomorrow when they face Young Africans in the Toyota Cup at Toyota Stadium in Bloemfontein.NASREDDINE Nabi is a realistic coach and that's why he's pleaded with the Kaizer Chiefs faithful to be patient and less emotional as the team embarks on a new journey.The new Chiefs coach has arrived at the club with high expectations, having won trophies throughout his career, including two titles with Young Africans.So much so that it was his pedigree that forced Chiefs to break the bank and bring him on board with four of his lieutenants in a bid to bring back the glory days.And having had a pre-season tour in Türkiye, where they also played friendlies, before returning to their base in Naturena on Tuesday, a lot is expected from Chiefs next season.However, Amakhosi will have to give their fans a snippet of their preparations under the Tunisian tomorrow when they face Young Africans in the Toyota Cup at Toyota Stadium in Bloemfontein.Nabi knows the toughness that comes with ending a nine-year barren run, but he's urged the Amakhosi faithful to allow the team to rebuild first.Nabi was not only bullish – in an address to the local media for the first time at the club's Village yesterday, but he looked the part too.The 58-year-old commanded respect as soon as he walked into the room, before hugging and briefly chatting to his Africans' successor, Miguel Gamondi, who was leaving.Nabi owned the moment as he also decided to stick to French in his address, using an English translator to narrate his responses.""Looking at the name Kaizer Chiefs and how big the name is, not only in South Africa but Africa, it's unacceptable for the club not to have the title in nine years,"" Nabi explained.""The picture and the place where the club is supposed to be and where it's been... is what made me want to come here and challenge myself to win the title.""But we need a very real strategy to put the club back to where it belongs. We need to be honest with ourselves and the supporters themselves.""We need to look at our quality without emotions. We need to look at what we have currently without being emotional.""Once we analyse what we have accordingly and put a strategy together of how to drive the club and team, then we should get where we want to go.""Nabi has his work cut out for him at Chiefs. While he has to be the brains behind the operation, the players and management have to buy into the vision as well.Already, the club has released four players – Keagan Dolly, Siyethemba Sithebe, Njabulo Ngcobo and Sifiso Hlanti – after their contracts came to an end in June.And that's not all. Chiefs have reportedly signed goalkeeper Fiarce Ntwari, and defenders Bongani Sam and Rushwin Dortley.Whether the release or signing of the players was decided with the coach remains unclear, but marketing director Jessica Motaung had said they want to make decisions with the coach.Nabi understands he must ensure he gets the best out of everyone and everything around him. Hence, he's focused on building a solid structure.""I don't want to make promises. I won't just be a populist, just making the fans hear what they want. Let's not be at that level. We need to prepare well and move from there,"" he added.""We understand that the fans are tired of promises and projects that are coming along. Every staff that comes during pre-season makes promises.""But we cannot do that – we are here to build the team. We want to build a strong team that will fight throughout the year and be recognised in Africa and internationally.""I am not making excuses for not having titles. However, we'll fight in each game for those three points. We need to be given a chance.""At this moment, we have good players at Kaizer Chiefs. We would like to have these players with other experienced players that will help us. We want to give them a perfect space and time.""Weekend Argus © 1999 - 2022 Independent Newspapers (Pty) Limited.

"Crime syndicates in Johor targeting luxury and 4x4 vehicles need just 30 seconds to make off with the cars, which are then smuggled and sold to neighbouring countries, said local police.They use devices that can start a car's ignition and jammers that turn off the vehicle's alarms and Global Positioning System, said Johor police chief M. Kumar at a press briefing on July 25.Many of these syndicates, which mainly steal cars, motorcycles and vehicle spare parts, were crushed during a month-long operation from June 21 to July 21, in which numerous district police forces in Johor were involved, he said.The police targeted car workshops, as well as vehicle and spare parts sellers, among others, and arrested more than 110 men and women aged 16 to 59.Some of those arrested were also wanted for drug offences, while around two dozen of them were involved in stealing luxury cars and motorcycles.The thieves would operate in small groups of two or three people, using rental cars to roam estates, ungated residential communities and shopping centre carparks, said Mr Kumar.Stolen cars would be transported to neighbouring countries by land, where a single vehicle could fetch up to RM40,000 (S$12,000) on the black market, he added, without naming the countries.Demand from these markets dictated which vehicles were targeted, Mr Kumar said.He listed car models by Japanese carmaker Toyota, such as the Fortuner, Vellfire, Alphard and Hilux, as among those frequently targeted by the syndicates. Older vehicles were also in demand on the black market, as their spare parts might have become difficult to obtain, he added.During the raids, the police confiscated more than 80 motor vehicles, including cars, a van, lorries and motorcycles, as well as bike frames and car components. The motor vehicles are expected to be returned to their owners after investigations are completed.Since January, 69 luxury and four-wheel drive cars valued at a total of RM8.8 million were reported lost in Johor, Mr Kumar said.The Johor police chief urged motorists to ensure their cars were well guarded by security systems.Copyright © 2024 SPH",2024-07-27,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240727:nNRAtdb3cq:1,Toyota,social

"New York, New York--(Newsfile Corp. - July 26, 2024) - WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a
global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Toyota
Motor Corporation (NYSE: TM) between June 23, 2022 and June 2, 2024, both
dates inclusive (the ""Class Period""), of the important August 23, 2024 lead
plaintiff deadline in the securities class action first filed by the Firm.SO WHAT: If you purchased Toyota securities during the Class Period you may be
entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs
through a contingency fee arrangement.WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Toyota class action, go to
https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/... or call Phillip Kim, Esq.
toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the
class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to
serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than August 23,
2024. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other
class members in directing the litigation.WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track
record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not
have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition.
Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are
merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually
litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm
represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in
securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm
has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a
Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class
Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The
firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered
hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured
over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was
named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys
have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class
Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to
disclose that: (1) Toyota understated its malfeasance relating to
certification of its cars and issues relating to overall legal compliance; and
(2) as a result, defendants' statements about its business, operations, and
prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable
basis at all times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit
claims that investors suffered damages.To join the Toyota class action, go to
https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/... or call Phillip Kim, Esq.
toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the
class action.No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not
represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your
choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this
point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not
dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.Follow us for updates on LinkedIn:

"Since it invaded Ukraine, Russia has faced increasing sanctions from its foreign trade partners, particularly the US and Europe.

Since these countries have together accounted for... Highlights you may have missedSince it invaded Ukraine, Russia has faced increasing sanctions from its foreign trade partners, particularly the US and Europe. Following the recent announcement of the US Treasury expanding its secondary sanctions programme, international pressure looks set to rachet up even further. However, the Russian economy seems to have broadly adapted to the new geopolitical environment and has seen signs of some recovery. In the Light Vehicle (LV) market, sales volumes are well on the way to recovery - after a near 60% drop in annual registrations in 2022, GlobalData estimates registrations to have grown by as much as 53% in 2023. The latest estimates for the Russian LV market show that new vehicle sales exceeded 675k units in the first half of 2024 - this constitutes a 78% improvement on the same period last year, an impressive figure compared to somewhat subdued results elsewhere in Europe. While some of this can be attributed to growth in GDP and domestic demand, this result indicates that the LV market has begun to adapt to the sanctions placed on Russia. We do not expect the market to grow as rapidly throughout the year, however, as much of this growth stems from a recovery from the low base of 2023.ASEAN fallingIn May, ASEAN Light Vehicle (LV) sales dropped by 5% YoY, marking the 10th consecutive month of declines. Recent data reveals that this downturn continued in June, with Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia experiencing slumps of -26% YoY, -12% YoY, and -4% YoY, respectively, during the month. Since these countries have together accounted for 73% of ASEAN LV sales this year, the overall ASEAN market is estimated to have dropped by 9.4% in June and 8.6% YoY in H1 2024.Volvo and tariffsQuestions about EU tariffs took centre stage during Volvo Cars' Q2 2024 results call, with president and CEO Jim Rowan giving reassurances that ""it's a short-term issue."" Particularly affected is the firm's China-made fully electric SUV the EX30, which the firm announced would have its production moved to Ghent, Belgium. ""We're going to start to see the impact of that [tariffs] in the second half of this year,"" Mr Rowan said. He did not give any clues as to whether pricing would change for the vehicle following the tariffs, instead adding that the firm was ""in a strong position"" and is ""looking at all the options available."" Asked whether Volvo could quantify the expected impact of the tariffs, CFO Johan Ekdahl said that it ""is an ongoing dialogue [with the EU Commission]. We don't know the final outcome - which is important to emphasise.""GM brand futureHow will GM manage diverging IC versus EV preferences in the US and China as it plans next generation Buicks and Cadillacs? two main own brands plus the three-way JV of SAIC-GM-Wuling make up the majority of the American OEM's sales in the giant Chinese market. Buick has been the company's own volume play for some years, with Cadillac also more successful in the PRC than it has been in the US. GM remains committed to an electric future in China - and eventually, North America too - but has to decide if it will continue making major investments in both EVs and gasoline-powered models. Some would say it has no choice but so far, the firm has held back on matching the bargain basement pricing of new electric and electrified models from multiple rival brands in China. And for that reason, Buick, Cadillac and Chevrolet sales have taken a major hit. This report looks at how General Motors might decide to proceed, highlighting certain cars, minivans/MPVs and SUVs. The most likely strategy appears to be a pullback (for now) on going all-in with EVs for Cadillac, instead offering hybrid/plug-in hybrid alternatives not only in North America but China too.Harris worriesWith president Joe Biden stepping down from the presidential race and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, the future of US climate policy - and its impact on the motor finance sector - could undergo significant transformation. Harris, known for her stance on climate issues and regulatory actions, could drive the US towards more stringent environmental standards and innovative financial mechanisms for the automotive industry. As vice president, Harris was instrumental in promoting the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the largest climate spending law in US history. The IRA aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 42% below 2005 levels by 2030, with significant implications for the automotive sector. The legislation's focus on clean energy and electric vehicle (EV) incentives aligns with the motor finance industry's growing shift towards sustainable investments and green financing options.Silicon boostCould a different approach to battery design address key barriers to broader EV adoption? Leading international developer and manufacturer of advanced silicon anode materials for lithium-ion batteries, Nexeon, has developed battery materials that it says enable a significantly higher cell energy density. Higher density allows for the design of smaller and more cost-effective batteries which, in turn, leads to enhanced performance for several applications, including EVs where range and charging times can be improved. We spoke to Scott Brown, CEO, Nexeon, to learn more about the battery technologies the company is working on and the benefits they can potentially bring to EVs.Disability challengesOne in five people in the UK live with a disability. It is predicted that the number of disabled disabled drivers, or passengers, in Britain could rise to 2.7 million by 2035. Alongside government regulations for the ending the sales of new ICE-only vehicles by 2035, these drivers will increasingly transition to EVs. However, disabled EV drivers face a number of additional challenges such as non-accessible charge points, difficulty in making payments, the inability to add ramps to vehicles and more. To assist with these pain-points, Motability Operations, the company that runs the life-changing Motability Scheme in the UK, has launched 'Go Charge', billed as a solution to simplify public EV charging for its customers. Partnering with tech company, Paua, 'Go Charge' provides a free app and card that streamlines the process of finding and paying for EV charging. It covers more than 70% of all rapid charge points across the UK. We spoke to head of innovation, Motability Operations, Jon Jenkins, to hear more about the assistance offered to disabled EV drivers, and the challenges they face.Split, money backRenault UK has promised prospective buyers of its Scenic E-Tech EV it is such the perfect family car to bring an end to in-car friction and offered money back if a couple splits up after buying one. There are, of course Ts &amp; Cs.Battery pactPowerCo, Volkswagen Group's battery firm, and QuantumScape have announced they have entered into an agreement to industrialise QuantumScape's next-generation solid-state lithium-metal battery technology. Upon satisfactory technical progress and certain royalty payments, QuantumScape will grant PowerCo the license to mass produce battery cells based on QuantumScape's technology platform. Under the non-exclusive license, PowerCo can manufacture up to 40 gigawatt-hours (GWh) per year using QuantumScape's technology with the option to expand up to 80 GWh annually, enough to outfit approximately one million vehicles per year.Its Q2 timeFord second quarter 2024 revenue was up 6% year on year to US$47.8bn on ""a slight increase in wholesales"". Net income was $1.8bn and adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, was $2.8bn with Ford, without provding comparisons, saying: ""Profitability was affected by an increase in warranty reserves, though efforts to lift the quality of new products are starting to pay off."" Ford Pro's second quarter EBIT was $2.6 billion, an increase of 7% and a margin of 15%. Segment revenue was $17bn, up 9% and three times the rate of growth in product shipments during the period.Hybrid partsToyota West Virginia has started production of the fifth generation hybrid transaxle. Assembly is a result of a US$300m investment at the plant announced in 2021 and 2022. The latest hybrid transaxle is used for Camry and Corolla Cross models made in the US. Since 2021, Toyota has announced new investment of $18.6bn into its US manufacturing operations to support electrification.Nissan disasterNissan posted quarterly operating profit barely in the black at just 1 billion yen for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. That compares with 128.6 billion yen posted for the same quarter last year. Revenues in the quarter were up 80.7 billion yen to 2,998.5 billion yen, the drop in profitability down to soft prices, model mix and heavy use of incentives in the US market. Nissan lowered its operating profit forecast for this fiscal year to 500 billion yen (previous forecast 600 billion yen).Stellantis weakStellantis has posted a set of disappointing financial results for the first half of the year as its brands struggled with product portfolio gaps, soft prices and swollen inventory. ""The company's performance in the first half of 2024 fell short of our expectations, reflecting both a challenging industry context as well as our own operational issues,"" said Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares. At ?85.0 billion, first half net revenues were down 14% y-o-y, while net profit at ?5.6 billion was down 48% on year-ago levels.Truck batteriesDaimler Truck has opened its Battery Technology Center (BTC) at the firm's plant in Mannheim, Germany. The facility measures 10,000 square metres, with cells to be produced here on a pilot basis in order to build up process knowledge. Additionally, battery packs will be manufactured as prototypes for test benches and test vehicles. With the pilot line for battery packs, the Mannheim site is preparing for future series production, planned for the second half of the decade as part of the introduction of the next generation of lithium-ion batteries at the plant.China closingHonda said this week it planned to close a vehicle assembly plant in China and suspend production at another, to step up its transition to zero emission vehicles. The move is part of a broader review of the company's global operations with the automaker having already announced earlier this month plans to consolidate vehicle production at one of its two assembly plants in Thailand from 2025 due to overcapacity. Honda has struggled in China with falling demand for internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles with local new energy vehicle (NEV) manufacturers behind much of the moderate domestic market growth in the last two years.UK plungeUK car production fell 7.6% in the first six months of the year, according to figures published by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). UK factories turned out 416,074 units, 34,094 fewer than in the same period in 2023, following a 26.6% decline in June caused by multiple model changes. The SMMT said the performance was expected as manufacturers retool lines to make electrified models following some £23.7 billion of UK investment announced last year.Have a nice weekend.Graeme Roberts, Deputy Editor, Just AutoCopyright © 2024 MarketLine",2024-07-26,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240726:nNRAtd9jbo:1,Toyota,social

See www.faruqilaw.com.As detailed below, this Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts, about the Company’s business and operations.  Specifically, Defendants misrepresented and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Toyota understated its malfeasance relating to certification of its cars and issues relating to overall legal compliance; and (2) as a result, defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.On June 3, 2024, The New York Times published an article entitled “Toyota and Other Japanese Carmakers Say They Mishandled Safety Tests.” This article stated, in pertinent part, that “Toyota [. . .] and other top Japanese automakers said on Monday that internal investigations found they had mishandled vehicle testing on dozens of models over the past decade.” Further, “Toyota said it had failed to gather proper data when doing pedestrian and occupant safety tests for three models, including its popular Yaris Cross sport utility vehicle.”On this news, Toyota’s American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) fell $5.34 per ADS, or 2.45%, to close at $212.17 per ADS on June 3, 2024.The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.  Faruqi &amp; Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Toyota’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.To learn more about the Toyota class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/TM or call Faruqi &amp; Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).Follow us for updates on LinkedIn, on X, or on Facebook.Attorney Advertising.

Video Transcript:
Asian stocks stabilize as a wild week winds down. Welcome to Asia Markets Briefing. I'm Ramzan Karmali. Well, the Yen stabilised near a 12-week high against the Dollar on Friday, while Asia-Pacific equity markets found their feet a day after their worst session since mid-April. South Korean shares rose as chipmakers rebounded, but also financials rallied in response to government tax cut proposals. Tech stocks also boosted the NIFTY 50, which had experienced five straight sessions of losses. Taiwan stocks fell more than 4% as investors there joined a global tech grant after a typhoon shut the markets for two days. TSMC, the world's largest chipmaker and major Apple supplier, saw its shares fall over 6% at one point. Well, Apple smartphone shipments in China fell by 6.7% in the second quarter of 2024. In contrast, Huawei smartphone shipments surged over the same period. The data from Canalys, a market research firm, also showed that the American tech-giantâs market share decreased from 16% to 14% in the same quarter of 2023. Core inflation in Japanâs capital accelerated for a third straight month in July. But an index gauging demand-driven price growth slowed. Tokyo's core CPI, which excludes volatile fresh food costs, rose 2.2% in July from 2.1% in June. But with energy costs stripped away, it slowed to 1.5% from the previous month to 1.8%. Well, that could complicate how soon the Bank of Japan decides to raise rates. Policymakers meet for two days next week, as well as debating whether to increase rates they'll also be laying out details on how the BOJ will taper its huge bond purchases. BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda has said the central bank will hike rates from current near-zero levels if it becomes more convinced that underlying inflation stays at around 2% in the coming years as it projects. According to LSEG estimates, the rate futures market has priced in a 67.2% chance that rates will rise by 10 basis points, up from a 40% chance earlier in the week. One strategist we spoke to noticed a significant move by the markets on Thursday.
Markets have been starting to up expectations or reprice the backdrop for next week's BOJ meeting. So, at one stage earlier in today's session, we had almost 9 basis points of tightening price for next week. So, combination of those factors have really encouraged a significant risk reversal and accordingly those risk barometer trades, including majority of those which are short of Yen have been unwound quite aggressively.
It's a busy week coming up on the corporate earnings front, especially in Japan with the likes of Yamaha and Japan Airlines reporting. Perhaps the highlight will be on Thursday, when car giant Toyota releases its first quarter results for 2025. Today, it was reported in The Nikkei that it is going to set up a new EV battery plant in Kyushu. And that's it from your Asia Markets Briefing.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

"Fitch Ratings-Jakarta-25 July 2024:
Fitch Ratings Indonesia has affirmed PT Toyota Astra Financial Services' (TAF) National Long-Term Rating at 'AAA(idn)' and National Short-Term Rating at 'F1+(idn)'. The Outlook on the National Long-Term Rating is Stable. The ratings on TAF's senior unsecured bonds and bond programme have also been affirmed at 'AAA(idn)'.'AAA' National Long-Term Ratings denote the highest rating assigned by the agency in its National Rating scale for that country. This rating is assigned to issuers or obligations with the lowest expectation of default risk relative to all other issuers or obligations in the same country or monetary union.'F1' National Short-Term Ratings indicate the strongest capacity for timely payment of financial commitments relative to other issuers or obligations in the same country. Under the agency's National Rating scale, this rating is assigned to the lowest default risk relative to others in the same country or monetary union. Where the liquidity profile is particularly strong, a ""+"" is added to the assigned rating.
Key Rating Drivers
Shareholder Support Anchors Rating: TAF's National Ratings are underpinned by our expectation of extraordinary support from its higher-rated ultimate shareholder, Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC, A+/Stable), if required. This stems from our view of TMC's strong ability and propensity to support TAF based on TMC's high credit rating and TAF's strong synergies with TMC.Considerable Ability to Support: We believe TMC has a strong ability to support TAF due to TAF's small size compared with the group. TAF's total assets accounted for only 0.4% of the group's consolidated assets at end-2023. TMC owns 50% of TAF, while PT Astra International Tbk, an Indonesian conglomerate that distributes Toyota's vehicles in Indonesia among its numerous business interests, holds the remaining stake.Important Market toShareholder: Our assessment of TMC's propensity to support TAF considers TAF's role as a captive financier for Toyota-group vehicles in Indonesia. It also reflects the Indonesian market's position and importance as TMC's fourth-largest market globally. TAF finances a significant proportion of TMC's sales in Indonesia and, thus, plays a synergistic role in maintaining Toyota's leadership in Indonesia's automotive industry.Our support assessment also considers the potential high reputational damage for TMC if TAF were to default, given their shared branding and TAF's extensive relationships with Japanese banks.Focus on Captive Brands: TAF predominantly finances sales of new Toyota and Daihatsu cars, as well as Lexus on a much smaller scale. Toyota and Daihatsu are the largest car brands in Indonesia with over 50% combined industry market share by unit of sales in 2023. TAF's contribution to the total unit sales of these brands has continued to increase in recent years.Modest Standalone Profile: TAF's standalone profile is not a key rating driver and Fitch estimates it is lower than the support-driven rating. The standalone profile is constrained by Indonesia's developing operating environment, as well as TAF's monoline business model, modest profitability and above-industry leverage. This is balanced by TAF's lower-risk portfolio relative to its peers, as evident from its consistently better asset quality compared with that of the industry.
RATING SENSITIVITIES Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade
TAF's rating is sensitive to Fitch's assessment of TMC's ability to support TAF, as the rating is anchored by the shareholder's rating. However, TAF's National Ratings would be resilient to a downgrade of up to three notches in TMC's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating.A perceived material decline in TMC's propensity to provide support would be negative for the rating. This could arise from a reduction in TMC's ownership that results in the automaker becoming a minority shareholder in TAF, or a deviation in TAF's strategy of supporting the parent's car sales in Indonesia. A downgrade could also be triggered by weakened synergies between TAF and TMC. However, we do not expect such changes in the near to medium term.
Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade
There is no upside to the National Ratings as they are already at the top of the scale.
DEBT AND OTHER INSTRUMENT RATINGS: KEY RATING DRIVERS
The ratings on the senior unsecured bonds are aligned with TAF's National Long-Term Rating, in accordance with Fitch's Non-Bank Financial Institutions Rating Criteria. This is because they represent direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the issuer and rank equally with all its other senior unsecured obligations.
DEBT AND OTHER INSTRUMENT RATINGS: RATING SENSITIVITIES
Any change in TAF's National Long-Term Rating would lead to a corresponding action on the debt ratings.

The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts.

This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report.

Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent).

"New York, New York--(Newsfile Corp. - July 25, 2024) - WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a
global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Toyota
Motor Corporation (NYSE: TM) between June 23, 2022 and June 2, 2024, both
dates inclusive (the ""Class Period""), of the important August 23, 2024 lead
plaintiff deadline in the securities class action first filed by the Firm.SO WHAT: If you purchased Toyota securities during the Class Period you may be
entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs
through a contingency fee arrangement.WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Toyota class action, go to
https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/... or call Phillip Kim, Esq.
toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the
class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to
serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than August 23,
2024. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other
class members in directing the litigation.WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track
record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not
have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition.
Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are
merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually
litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm
represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in
securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm
has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a
Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class
Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The
firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered
hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured
over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was
named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys
have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class
Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to
disclose that: (1) Toyota understated its malfeasance relating to
certification of its cars and issues relating to overall legal compliance; and
(2) as a result, defendants' statements about its business, operations, and
prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable
basis at all times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit
claims that investors suffered damages.To join the Toyota class action, go to
https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/... or call Phillip Kim, Esq.
toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the
class action.No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not
represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your
choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this
point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not
dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.Follow us for updates on LinkedIn:

(https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/MAzoDhKVKM).Toyota is a Japanese car manufacturer.On June 3, 2024, the New York Times published an article entitled ""Toyota and
Other Japanese Carmakers Say They Mishandled Safety Tests."" This article
stated that ""Toyota . . . and other top Japanese automakers said on Monday
that internal investigations found they had mishandled vehicle testing on
dozens of models over the past decade."" Further, ""Toyota said it had failed to
gather proper data when doing pedestrian and occupant safety tests for three
models, including its popular Yaris Cross sport utility vehicle.""On this news, Toyota's American Depositary Shares (""ADSs"") fell $5.34 per ADS,

overall legal compliance; and (2) as a result, defendants' statements about

(https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/bVDOYSOPO0)A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class
members in directing the litigation. The lead plaintiff is usually the
investor or small group of investors who have the largest financial interest
and who are also adequate and typical of the proposed class of investors. The
lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class
and these attorneys, if approved by the court, are lead or class counsel. Your
ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision
whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. Communicating with any counsel is
not necessary to participate or share in any recovery achieved in this case.
Any member of the purported class may move the Court to serve as a lead
plaintiff through counsel of his/her choice, or may choose to do nothing and
remain an inactive class member.Berger Montague, with offices in Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Delaware,
Washington, D.C., San Diego, San Francisco and Chicago, has been a pioneer in

would like to learn about a potential recovery, CLICK HERE
(https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/JgDRKtDa2X).The lawsuit has been filed against Toyota on behalf of purchasers of Toyota
securities between June 23, 2022 and June 2, 2024, inclusive (the ""Class
Period"").The deadline for investors who purchased or acquired Toyota securities during
the Class Period to seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of
the class, is August 23, 2024.Toyota is a Japanese car manufacturer.According to the lawsuit, on June 3, 2024, the New York Times published an
article entitled ""Toyota and Other Japanese Carmakers Say They Mishandled
Safety Tests."" This article stated that ""Toyota . . . and other top Japanese
automakers said on Monday that internal investigations found they had
mishandled vehicle testing on dozens of models over the past decade."" Further,
""Toyota said it had failed to gather proper data when doing pedestrian and
occupant safety tests for three models, including its popular Yaris Cross
sport utility vehicle.""On this news, Toyota's American Depositary Shares (""ADSs"") fell $5.34 per ADS,

investor or small group of investors who have the largest financial interest
and who are also adequate and typical of the proposed class of investors. The
lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class
and these attorneys, if approved by the court, are lead or class counsel. Your
ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision
whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. Communicating with any counsel is
not necessary to participate or share in any recovery achieved in this case.
Any member of the purported class may move the Court to serve as a lead
plaintiff through counsel of his/her choice, or may choose to do nothing and
remain an inactive class member.Berger Montague (https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/QOJz1h2zbP), with

"New York, New York--(Newsfile Corp. - July 26, 2024) - WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a
global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Toyota
Motor Corporation (NYSE: TM) between June 23, 2022 and June 2, 2024, both
dates inclusive (the ""Class Period""), of the important August 23, 2024 lead
plaintiff deadline in the securities class action first filed by the Firm.SO WHAT: If you purchased Toyota securities during the Class Period you may be
entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs
through a contingency fee arrangement.WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Toyota class action, go to
https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/... or call Phillip Kim, Esq.
toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the
class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to
serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than August 23,
2024. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other
class members in directing the litigation.WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track
record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not
have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition.
Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are
merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually
litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm
represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in
securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm
has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a
Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class
Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The
firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered
hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured
over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was
named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys
have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class
Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to
disclose that: (1) Toyota understated its malfeasance relating to
certification of its cars and issues relating to overall legal compliance; and
(2) as a result, defendants' statements about its business, operations, and
prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable
basis at all times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit
claims that investors suffered damages.To join the Toyota class action, go to
https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/... or call Phillip Kim, Esq.
toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the
class action.No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not
represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your
choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this
point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not
dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.Follow us for updates on LinkedIn:

"NEW YORK, July  23, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE: TM) between June 23, 2022 and June 2, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important August 23, 2024 lead plaintiff deadline in the securities class action first filed by the Firm.SO WHAT: If you purchased Toyota securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Toyota class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=25663 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than August 23, 2024. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases.  Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Toyota understated its malfeasance relating to certification of its cars and issues relating to overall legal compliance; and (2) as a result, defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.To join the Toyota class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=25663 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.Follow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm or on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm.Attorney Advertising.

     On June 3, 2024, Toyota filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission an English translation of an announcement that Toyota filed with
the Tokyo Stock Exchange earlier that day. Toyotas announcement said that
after investigat[ing] its model certification applications as per
instructions from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and
Tourism (MLIT), Toyota discovered that seven models . . . were tested using
methods that differed from the government standards[.] That same day, The
New York Times published an article entitled Toyota and Other Japanese
Carmakers Say They Mishandled Safety Tests. The article reported that
Toyota [. . .] and other top Japanese automakers [acknowledged] that
internal investigations found they had mishandled vehicle testing on dozens
of models over the past decade. Further, Toyota said it had failed to
gather proper data when doing pedestrian and occupant safety tests for

"ROSEN, A GLOBAL AND LEADING LAW FIRM, Encourages Toyota Motor Corporation Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action First Filed by the Firm TMTOYOTA MOTOR CORP (""TM-N"")
- ROSEN, A GLOBAL AND LEADING LAW FIRM, Encourages Toyota Motor
- Corporation Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important
- Deadline in Securities Class Action First Filed by the Firm - TM

     WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds
purchasers of securities of Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE: TM) between
June 23, 2022 and June 2, 2024, both dates inclusive (the Class Period), of
the important August 23, 2024 lead plaintiff deadline in the securities
class action first filed by the Firm.

     SO WHAT: If you purchased Toyota securities during the Class Period
you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket
fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.

     WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Toyota class action, go to
https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=25663 or call Phillip Kim, Esq.
toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on
the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you
wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than
August 23, 2024. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on
behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.

     WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with
a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices
do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer
recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class
actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law
firms that actually litigate the cases.  Be wise in selecting counsel. The
Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its
practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation.
Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action
settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by
ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action
settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since
2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In
2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020,
founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of
Plaintiffs Bar. Many of the firms attorneys have been recognized by
Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.

     DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout
the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or
failed to disclose that: (1) Toyota understated its malfeasance relating to
certification of its cars and issues relating to overall legal compliance;
and (2) as a result, defendants statements about its business, operations,
and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a
reasonable basis at all times. When the true details entered the market,
the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

     To join the Toyota class action, go to
https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=25663 or call Phillip Kim, Esq.
toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on
the class action.

     No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not
represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of
your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at
this point. An investors ability to share in any potential future recovery
is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

"TOYOTA MOTOR CORP (""TM-N"")
- Faruqi &amp; Faruqi, LLP Investigates Claims on Behalf of Investors
- of Toyota

     Securities Litigation Partner James (Josh) Wilson Encourages Investors
Who Suffered Losses In Toyota To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their
Options

     If you purchased or acquired securities in Toyota between June 25,
2022 and June 2, 2024 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call
Faruqi &amp; Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or
212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310). You may also click here for additional
information: www.faruqilaw.com/TM.

     Faruqi &amp; Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is
investigating potential claims against Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota or
the Company) (NYSE: TM) and reminds investors of the August 23, 2024
deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class
action that has been filed against the Company.

     Faruqi &amp; Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices
in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered
hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995.
See www.faruqilaw.com.

     As detailed below, this Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class
Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as
well as failed to disclose material adverse facts, about the Companys
business and operations. Specifically, Defendants misrepresented and/or
failed to disclose that: (1) Toyota understated its malfeasance relating to
certification of its cars and issues relating to overall legal compliance;
and (2) as a result, defendants statements about its business, operations,
and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a
reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the
market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

     On June 3, 2024, The New York Times published an article entitled
Toyota and Other Japanese Carmakers Say They Mishandled Safety Tests. This
article stated, in pertinent part, that Toyota [. . .] and other top
Japanese automakers said on Monday that internal investigations found they
had mishandled vehicle testing on dozens of models over the past decade.
Further, Toyota said it had failed to gather proper data when doing
pedestrian and occupant safety tests for three models, including its
popular Yaris Cross sport utility vehicle.

     On this news, Toyotas American Depositary Shares (ADSs) fell $5.34 per
ADS, or 2.45%, to close at $212.17 per ADS on June 3, 2024.

     The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest
financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and
typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf
of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court
to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose
to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in
any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff
or not.

     Faruqi &amp; Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding
Toyotas conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former
employees, shareholders and others.

     To learn more about the Toyota class action, go to
www.faruqilaw.com/TM or call Faruqi &amp; Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly
at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a

Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to
disclose that: (1) Toyota understated its malfeasance relating to
certification of its cars and issues relating to overall legal compliance; and

"NEW YORK, July  16, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE: TM) between June 23, 2022 and June 2, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important August 23, 2024 lead plaintiff deadline in the securities class action first filed by the Firm.SO WHAT: If you purchased Toyota securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Toyota class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=25663 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than August 23, 2024. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases.  Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Toyota understated its malfeasance relating to certification of its cars and issues relating to overall legal compliance; and (2) as a result, defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.To join the Toyota class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=25663 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.Follow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm or on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm.Attorney Advertising.

- Contact the Firm

     The law firm of Kirby McInerney LLP reminds investors that a class
action lawsuit has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central
District of California on behalf of those who acquired Toyota Motor
Corporation (Toyota or the Company) (NYSE: TM) securities during the period
of June 23, 2022 to June 2, 2024, inclusive (the Class Period). Investors
have until August 23, 2024 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead
plaintiff in the lawsuit.

     [Click here to learn more about the class action]

     On June 3, 2024, The New York Times published an article entitled
Toyota and Other Japanese Carmakers Say They Mishandled Safety Tests.
According to the article, [t]he Japanese authorities had told Toyota and
other car companies to conduct investigations into their compliance with
national standards for safety and other issues. Toyota stated that it had
failed to gather proper data when doing pedestrian and occupant safety
tests for three models, including its popular Yaris Cross sport utility
vehicle, and that it would temporarily halt shipments of three of the
affected models it produces in Japan. On the same day, the Associated Press
released an article entitled Toyota apologizes for cheating on vehicle
testing and halts production of three models. On this news, the price of
Toyota American Depositary Shares (ADSs) declined by $5.34 per ADS, to
close at $212.17 per ADS on June 3, 2024.

     The lawsuit alleges that Toyota throughout the Class Period made false
and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose, among other things,
that Toyota understated its malfeasance relating to certification of its
cars and issues relating to overall legal compliance.

     If you purchased or otherwise acquired Toyota securities, have

Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota or the Company) (NYSE: TM) securities
between June 23, 2022 and June 2, 2024, inclusive (the Class Period).

     On June 3, 2024, The New York Times reported that Toyota [. . .] and
other top Japanese automakers [acknowledged] that internal investigations
found they had mishandled vehicle testing on dozens of models over the past
decade. Additionally, the article stated that Toyota had failed to gather
proper data when doing pedestrian and occupant safety tests for three
models, including its popular Yaris Cross sport utility vehicle.

     On this news, Toyotas stock price fell $5.34, or 2.5%, to close at
$212.17 per share on June 3, 2024, thereby injuring investors.

     The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the
Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading
statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the
Companys business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants
failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Toyota understated its
malfeasance relating to certification of its cars and issues relating to
overall legal compliance; and (2) as a result, Defendants positive
statements about the Companys business, operations, and prospects were
materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant
times.

     If you purchased or otherwise acquired Toyota securities during the
Class Period, you may move the Court no later than August 23, 2024 to

".storyContent span.prnews_span.storyContent li.prnews_li.storyContent p.prnews_pPR NewswireESCONDIDO, Calif., July 17, 2024ESCONDIDO, Calif., July 17, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- SolarTech, a leading solar provider for residential, commercial, and nonprofit clients in California, recently installed a tailor-made solar solution for Escondido auto dealerships Toyota of Escondido and Hyundai of Escondido. Recognizing the need to adapt to escalating energy costs and evolving market demands for sustainability, the dealerships sought solar energy solutions with SolarTech to address cost savings and market positioning goals.Facing time-sensitive challenges, including the anticipated shift towards electric vehicles by 2030 and imminent changes in Net Energy Metering (NEM) policies, Toyota and Hyundai Escondido sought swift solar solutions to maximize financial benefits amidst changing regulations. Toyota Escondido also aimed to leverage vehicle allocation incentives for sustainable capital improvements under Toyota's Vehicle Supplemental Support program.SolarTech successfully navigated several challenges throughout this large-scale solar installation. Due to supply chain constraints, the modules delivered to the site differed in physical dimensions from those specified in the system design. SolarTech re-engineered the solar layouts and collaborated with city officials for expedited approval, limiting delays to just 30 days. Working around the limited space and operational hours at both dealerships, SolarTech, along with Toyota and Hyundai management, organized a ""solar day"", a coordinated 24-hour event to install over 1800 modules with minimal disruption.As a result of SolarTech's adaptable engineering, partnerships with city and utility officials, Toyota and Hyundai Escondido stand to save over $20M in energy costs over the next 30 years. Toyota Escondido secured an allocation of an additional 131 vehicles, enhancing their sales potential. Both solar arrays will generate additional energy to service upcoming EV charging stations and favorable NEM 2.0 rates were locked in before legislative changes could diminish returns.""We reached out to SolarTech because our facility, with its extensive service bays, was facing an enormous electricity bill. SolarTech provided expert advice on the best solutions to save us money, and the results have been remarkable—our electricity costs have gone way down! You couldn't believe the efficiency that SolarTech was able to provide this facility. In my 32 years at Toyota of Escondido, SolarTech has been the best company to work with,"" stated Damian Campos, Senior Sales Manager.About SolarTech SolarTech is a full-service solar energy company delivering integrated, high-performance solutions for residential, commercial, and non-profit clients in California, Arizona, and Colorado.  Its services include solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, energy storage systems (ESS), electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, roofing, solar pool heating systems, and the delivery of comprehensive maintenance programs.With over two decades of experience, SolarTech provides timely project delivery, prioritizes job site safety, and upholds the value of in-house expertise with a team of certified solar analysts, technicians, and installers.  Their dependable, solutions-oriented team provides high-quality, efficient, and sustainable energy solutions that meet the unique needs of each customer.  For more information, visit www.solartechonline.com.

".storyContent span.prnews_span.storyContent li.prnews_li.storyContent p.prnews_pPR NewswirePLANO, Texas, July 12, 2024Styled with a New Ridge Green Exterior, Ultrasuede Interior, Bronze Wheels, Spoiler and Hakone BadgeAll 2025 GR86's Handling Dynamics Improved with Retuned Shocks, Electric Power Steering and moreArriving at Toyota Dealerships in Fall 2024PLANO, Texas, July 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- A blast from the past is returning for the 2025 model year. Paying tribute to the Hakone Turnpike in Japan, not far from Tokyo, Toyota is reintroducing the GR86 Hakone special edition. Born to hit the streets in style, the GR86 Hakone special edition is sure to turn heads with its bold Ridge Green exterior color.Built off the GR86 Premium grade, the Hakone special edition will have a choice of a six-speed manual or automatic transmission and will be powered by a 2.4-liter, 4-cylinder boxer engine generating 228 horsepower and 184 lb.-ft. The special edition will feature 18-inch satin bronze-finished wheels, a color-keyed duck-tail spoiler, black accents and a Hakone badge.On the inside, customers will find Ultrasuede® sport seats with tan leather trim and stitching. A Hakone special edition shift knob with bronze accents sits front and center and a GR special edition plaque adds to the unique look and feel.Brembo® Brakes and SACHS Dampers come standard on the Hakone special edition providing a stellar driving experience with industry-leading features.There will only be 860 units produced for the U.S. market for 2025. Customers can expect the Hakone special edition and all GR86 grades to arrive at Toyota dealerships in the Fall of 2024. The Manufacturers Suggested Retail Price for the GR86 Hakone special edition and the complete GR86 2025 lineup will be shared later this year.Toyota GAZOO Racing Inspired Driving PerformanceThe GR engineering team is always looking to take learnings from the track and include them on GR cars. For 2025, GR86 shock absorbers have been re-tuned to help improve handling response and a sense of ground contact. Throttle mapping revised to increase the ease of ""blipping,"" an action commonly used when performing heel-toe downshifts in a motorsport setting. Furthermore, engine torque control has been adopted to provide a more direct throttle response and linearity, which in turn improves ease of control at all speeds. The Electric Power Steering has also been re-tuned for a more responsive handling feel and an improved sense of direct contact with the road.The GR86 Hakone special edition comes standard with SACHS Dampers and Brembo® Brakes. A Performance Package is also available as an option on other 2025 GR86 grades that include these features. The SACHS Dampers are filled with high-pressure nitrogen and oil and are designed to absorb vibrations across a wide range of speeds, maximize ground contact, and support firm, stable steering, while also balancing road feedback and ride comfort. The red-painted Brembo 4-piston front and 2-piston rear brake calipers clamp down on smooth surfaced 12.8 x 1.3-in front rotors, with 12.4 x .79-in. rotors in the rear. The brake pad area is 11.6-in2 in the front and 4.9-in2 in the rear.The dampers and brakes complement the GR86's chassis, which is known for its taut, responsive feel. Crafted from a combination of high-strength steel, hot-stamped steel, and aluminum, each material in the frame is strategically placed to bring drivers a balance of roll and pitch that maximizes control. Up front it uses diagonal cross members and high-strength fasteners to join the front suspension and frame together. At the rear, a full ring structure and high-strength fasteners connect the frame and suspension mounts. For additional reinforcement, structural adhesive has been added throughout the underbody. Altogether creating a cohesive, connected frame.Lightweight and FunAll GR86 models pack in modern engineering, tech, and convenience – while sticking to the lightweight sports car roots.Weighing in at just 2,811 pounds for the manual transmission equipped Base grade model, and at 2,851 pounds for the automatic version, the GR86 is among the lightest sports cars on the market. An aluminum hood, front fenders and roof panel help keep the weight down on the body. While details such as the use of structural adhesives in the frame and seats that are over six pounds lighter than the prior generation 86, help save precious ounces in the name of maximum control.The naturally aspirated 2.4-liter FA-24 engine delivers 228 horsepower and 184 lb.-ft. of torque and is tuned so that peak torque arrives at 3,700 RPM, resulting in a responsive and powerful driving experience. Zero-to-60 acceleration comes in at 6.1 seconds for the 6-speed manual transmission, and 6.6 seconds for the available six-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission (ECT-i). With either transmission, the GR86 comes equipped with a Torsen® limited-slip rear differential for enhanced traction while cornering.Sports car purists will love GR86's 6-speed manual transmission. With the push of a button, drivers can engage Track mode or switch off Vehicle Stability Control (VSC). And on the automatic transmission GR86, additional clutch discs and a high-capacity torque converter allow for smooth delivery of the 2.4-liter engine's higher power and torque.On the inside of GR86, drivers will experience a low-slung, driver-focused cockpit with digital instrument panel, push-button start, HVAC system with LED dials and piano-key switches, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel with integrated controls for the audio system. For the 6-speed automatic, steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters offer enthusiasts a dynamic driving experience. The manual downshift mode has also increased by maximum 1600 RPM to allow for a higher RPM downshift. Drivers can choose between Normal, Sport or Snow modes. When in Sport mode, the transmission senses brake and accelerator operation and vehicle behavior to automatically select the optimal gear, bringing drivers the control they want.An 8-inch touchscreen multimedia system with a six-speaker audio system comes standard on the Base grade and an eight-speaker system is standard on the Hakone special edition and Premium grade. For seating, the Premium grade comes with Ultrasuede® and leather-trim with black stitching, six-way adjustable front seats with two-level heating. The Base grade has six-way adjustable black G-embossed fabric with sport fabric side bolsters.

V2G technology has the potential to support and provide benefits to customers through improved energy reliability and resilience, the integration of renewables, and the possibility of reduced electricity costs.This collaboration aims to understand the needs of EV owners through their charging habits and vehicle usage, which will be crucial in driving widespread adoption of V2G technology. Nearly 80 percent of owners currently charge their EVs at home overnight when demand for energy is lower. With bidirectional capability, these vehicles could send power back to the local energy grid during peak demand hours or at other critical times, such as severe weather.  ""Bidirectional charging is a great way for customers to leverage their electric vehicles in a way that supports the grids and their home electricity ecosystem,"" said Christopher Yang, group vice president, Toyota EV Charging Solutions. ""Working with Pepco will help us understand charging and discharging use-cases, which will ultimately benefit our customers and help utility providers better understand grid demands.""Maryland is one of the fastest growing EV markets in the nation and is targeting to have 300,000 EVs on the road by 2025. Pepco is helping Maryland lead this charge by installing 250 EV chargers across Montgomery and Prince George's Counties. In April, Maryland also became the first state to pass vehicle-to-grid legislation when it passed HB 1256 – the Distributed Renewable Integration and Vehicle Electrification (DRIVE) Act – that requires utilities to develop interconnection processes for bidirectional chargers.""Pepco is leading the energy transformation in the communities we serve by embracing technology that is helping to drive the clean energy transition,"" said Tyler Anthony, president and CEO of Pepco Holdings. ""V2G is designed to connect with the local energy grid and is part of our roadmap to ensure a successful and equitable energy transition. This collaboration with Toyota allows us to better understand V2G technology and its impact on the grid, our customers, and overall service reliability as we work together toward a more sustainable and resilient future for the communities we serve.""The V2G research will take place at Pepco's Watershed Sustainability Center, located at the company's Rockville Service Center in Montgomery County, Maryland, using a bidirectional charger. Pepco will lead the effort to design and evaluate a variety of EV charging and discharging use-cases that can potentially provide grid and customer benefits. The demonstration project will also assist Pepco in understanding the infrastructure needed to enable the rapid growth of EV charging infrastructure and the nuances of interconnecting large numbers of V2G assets to the grid to better prepare the utility to implement requirements of the DRIVE Act and support customer adoption of this technology. Currently, Toyota offers two mass-market BEVs in the U.S. and Canada – the Toyota bZ4X and Lexus RZ. Toyota recently announced plans for two all-new three-row BEV SUVs that will be assembled at Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky (TMMK) and Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indiana (TMMI). By 2030, Toyota aspires to offer 30 BEV models globally across its Toyota and Lexus brand nameplates and produce up to 3.5 million BEVs annually.About Toyota:Toyota (NYSE:TM), creator of the Prius hybrid and the Mirai fuel cell vehicle, is committed to building vehicles for the way people live through our Toyota and Lexus brands, and directly employs more than 63,000 people in North America (more than 49,000 in the U.S.).Over the past 65 years, Toyota has assembled nearly 47 million cars and trucks in North America at the company's 12 manufacturing plants.

The automotive industry is transforming with new ownership models, cutting-edge connectivity, and innovative advanced electrified powertrains.But with change, comes questions: why are automakers focusing so much on electrified powertrains? What does this shift, marked by the futuristic hum, really mean for consumers, and is this transformation really necessary?At the core, it comes down to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. CO2 is essential to life on earth, but too much poses a threat. When in balance, CO2 helps keep planet Earth warm enough to sustain life; however, an imbalance can lead to a much warmer average temperature, which can lead to bringing forward the predicted results of climate change.But where does this excess CO2 come from? Natural sources make up the majority of CO2 released into the atmosphere: Oceans, animal and plant respiration, organic matter decomposition, forest fires, and emissions from volcanic eruptions.Another contributor to CO2 emissions is human activity, including power generation, industrial sources, chemical production, agricultural practices, and transportation. Of all sectors, transportation accounts for the largest percentage of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the United States, coming in at 28%. Between 1990 and 2021r, GHG emissions within the transportation sector, including carbon dioxide, increased more than any other human-based activity. Science has shown that CO2 is a contributing factor to climate change, and, as such, efforts by governments, companies, and individuals to reduce or eliminate CO2 emissions are gaining momentum. After all, CO2 emissions can remain in the atmosphere for hundreds of years, and the impact of emissions in one region can be felt globally.As automobile tailpipes are prevalently visible by so many people each day, transportation, especially the automotive industry, has become a focal point. Fortunately, various solutions are being deployed: regulations, incentives, innovative products, technologies, and services are converging to combat CO2.To explore these critical topics, a compelling three-part video series, Driving Decarbonization in America, has been produced by Bader Media Group, funded by Toyota. Hosted by Ross Butler with field reporting from Neka Zang and Ariana Cohen, the series immerses viewers in the world of CO2 emissions and what is being done in the automotive industry. Examining what carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases are, the series delves into the relentless drive to reduce or eliminate CO2 from new vehicles. By exploring the various vehicle types, powertrains, and technologies that have shaped – and continue to shape – the industry landscape, viewers are taken on a dynamic journey that spans past, present, and future innovations in sustainable mobility.Providing a rare glimpse into the automakers' perspective, the series' hosts speak with the world's largest manufacturer, Toyota, providing an in-depth look at their multi-pathway approach to vehicles and technology, alongside other companies dedicated to driving decarbonization.The series will air on MotorTrend TV with availability on the DISCOVERY GO App and DISCOVERY+ Streaming. The world premiere of the episodes will be:Episode 1June 17, 20245:00 PM – 5:30 PM (ET/PT)Episode 2July 19, 20245:00 PM – 5:30 PM (ET/PT)Episode 3August 26, 20245:00 PM – 5:30 PM (ET/PT)All Three EpisodesAugust 31, 20249:00 AM – 10:30 AM (ET/PT)In the series, viewers will learn:From Subject Matter Experts:The series will provide viewers with valuable knowledge shared by industry analysts, researchers, engineers, thinktanks, and company executives. These experts will discuss the significance of carbon dioxide emissions and how combined efforts are driving decarbonization.Vehicle Electrification:A portfolio of low- and zero-emission vehicles are currently available and are helping reduce CO2 emissions today. Hybrid, plug-in hybrid, fuel cell and battery electric vehicles will be discussed, shedding light on how choices can help consumers find a way to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions.Automotive Batteries:The push towards electrification means more automotive batteries. While having more battery electric vehicles on the road may mean less tailpipe-emissions, what about other sources of emissions? Are we just shifting CO2 emissions from the tailpipe to somewhere else? Innovations in battery recycling and ways to optimize supply chain logistics will be key to this growing area.Existing Vehicles:There is a significant emphasis on new vehicles and their emissions, but what about the vehicles that are not electrified? Even with the most optimistic projections indicating that 50% or more of new vehicle sales in the United States will be battery electric by 2032, the fact remains that a large portion of vehicles on the road will still have internal combustion engines, meaning they may still emit carbon dioxide. If reducing carbon is so important and a priority, is there a solution that can help reduce CO2 emissions from these and other legacy vehicles?Utility/energy systems:Electric vehicles also bring with them the possibility of bidirectional charging, where electricity can be taken off the grid to charge the batteries, but also flow the other way. But when is the best time to charge, and is the electricity being used coming from renewable energy sources? How can vehicles become a tool for utility companies to help make the overall energy grid more resilient?Join us as we follow Ross' journey as he explores the increasingly important topics of the future of transportation and CO2 emissions through this three-part series this summer.About ToyotaToyota (NYSE:TM) has been a part of the cultural fabric in the U.S. for more than 65 years, and is committed to advancing sustainable, next-generation mobility through our Toyota and Lexus brands, plus our nearly 1,500 dealerships. Toyota directly employs more than 49,000 people in the U.S. who have contributed to the design, engineering, and assembly of more than 34 million cars and trucks at our nine manufacturing plants.

Rear seats include ample cushioning and bolster support for maximum enjoyment.Dual zone climate control is also standard, as accessed via a thin illuminated control panel that runs along the dashboard, just below the multimedia screen, along with other frequently used functions. For added interior temperature control, windows on both grades are made from High Solar Energy Absorbing glass.All Toyota Crown Signia grades also receive a 12.3-inch fully digital gauge cluster with selectable gauges. Drivers can choose different display layouts with the push of a button, including a Hybrid System Indicator that shows system output and regeneration status to encourage eco-driving habits. As used on other Toyota hybrid models, the display suggests optimal amounts of acceleration for eco-driving.Toyota Crown Signia Limited grade includes a standard fixed panoramic moonroof. For added function and ambience, in-cabin LED lighting adds a premium feel. Illumination includes overhead and front/rear footwell lighting, cup holders, USB ports, door handle accents, and the rear cargo area.To aid outward visibility, the Limited grade comes with an available Panoramic View Monitor on the Advanced Tech Package, which provides a 360-degree overhead view of the vehicle's surroundings . Both XLE and Limited have a backup camera with projected path and dynamic gridlines, standard. For additional convenience, a Smart Key System that works on all four doors is also standard on both grades.A Sanctuary on the RoadFor customers who seek premium experiences in a vehicle, keeping unwanted noise out is paramount. The 2025 Toyota Crown Signia's cabin brings that priority quietly home. Rather than simply aiming at a ""numbers"" goal for sound level (decibels), Toyota engineers created a calm atmosphere conducive to enjoying easy conversation or hearing music in cleaner detail. The Toyota Crown Signia is assembled at the Tsutsumi Plant in Aichi, Japan and uses the same TNGA-K platform that underpins the Crown sedan.The high-strength TNGA-K platform is the first defense against noise intrusion, curbing vibration through the steering, floor and structure. Suspension tuning resists road surface disturbances and tire noise is reduced via strategically placed insulation and thoughtful tire/wheel construction. Engineers also undertook extensive analysis of noise transmission paths and filled spaces around door frames, window openings and wiring harnesses for enhanced cabin quietness. Even the inner rocker and bulkhead are connected with adhesive to minimize noise.The Toyota Crown Signia also uses acoustic glass on the front driver and passenger side windows to minimize noise in the cabin. Insulation and body sealing material are placed throughout the structure, between the engine bay and cabin, under the carpeting and above the headliner for additional sound-deadening. The materials and their placement were optimized to minimize noise in the frequencies that typically interfere with conversation.The Signature HybridThe 2025 Crown Signia is equipped with the Toyota Hybrid System (THS), standard. This system's primary components include a 2.5-liter DOHC four-cylinder engine, a hybrid transaxle, and a bi-polar Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) battery. All these systems work together, using a combination of a gas engine and electric motors to drive the vehicle's wheels for a balance of optimum power and fuel efficiency, depending on the driving conditions. The hybrid transaxle houses four components: two electric motor-generators (MG1 and MG2); a single planetary gear; and a reduction gear to the final drive. MG1 serves primarily as a generator, driven by the gasoline engine, and provides a charge to hybrid battery. It also serves as the engine's starter motor. MG2 drives the front wheels alone or in tandem with the internal combustion engine as needed. MG2 also acts as a generator, recovering kinetic energy when coasting or braking and converting it to electrical charge for the battery. In certain conditions, MG2 can also power the vehicle in full electric (EV) mode at low speeds.The Crown Signia's 230.4V bi-polar NiMH traction battery has a capacity of 5.0 Ahr and stores electricity for use by the motor generators. The battery is a compact unit that is located entirely beneath the rear seats, avoiding any intrusion in the rear cargo area. Its bi-polar construction helps reduce the overall battery size and weight, and benefits performance, since bipolar electrodes minimize the internal electrical resistance.The 2.5-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine uses variable valve timing to utilize the efficiency of Atkinson cycle operation. This timing provides a shorter compression stroke and longer power stroke, resulting in excellent fuel efficiency and low emissions. The engine turns MG1 to charge the battery and provides power to the front wheels alongside MG2. Pairing this engine with Crown Signia's standard electronically controlled Continuously Variable Transmission provides exceptionally smooth, shift-free power delivery.Crown Signia also comes standard with selectable NORMAL, ECO and SPORT driving modes that let the driver tailor drivetrain performance. SPORT mode sharpens throttle response, enhancing the fun-to-drive experience. ECO mode changes the throttle and climate control logic to maximize efficiency, while NORMAL mode is ideal for everyday driving. Additionally, an EV (Electric Vehicle) mode allows electric-only driving at low speeds for short distances.Overall, the Toyota Hybrid System delivers an EPA- estimated 39/37/38 MPG (city/highway/combined) rating and the Crown Signia can go from zero to 60 MPH in 7.1 seconds.Elevated Handling with Standard AWDThe Toyota Crown Signia delivers the best of both worlds: sedan-like driving comfort and SUV versatility. It has a 6.7-inch ground clearance, 74-inch overall width, and 112.2-inch wheelbase for a firmly planted, car-like feel. The 25.8-inch hip point gives it a lifted seating position for easy ingress and egress and an elevated view of the road.Equipped with Toyota's electronic On-Demand AWD standard, the Crown Signia's AWD system takes maximum advantage of the hybrid powertrain's benefits while also being capable of towing up to 2,700 pounds.Instead of using a transfer case and driveshaft to send power to the rear wheels, the AWD system employs a separate rear-mounted electric motor (MGR) to send power to the rear wheels when needed, like when cornering or in slippery conditions. The front and rear wheel driving force distribution is precisely controlled between 100:0 and 20:80, for enhanced fuel efficiency and comfortable driving performance. MGR not only provides power to the rear wheels but can also deliver power proactively in ideal conditions to improve driving dynamics and act as a generator, providing charge to the Hybrid battery when coasting or braking.A blend of lightweight, high-strength materials support rigidity, like a ring frame structure in the rear, a combination of plate spot and laser welds on the body, and the use of structural adhesive throughout the frame. The steering gearbox is mounted directly to the suspension cross member for a direct steering feel that minimizes line correction. Aero-stabilizing underbody panels with a ""stepped"" texture help control airflow under the vehicle a firmly planted ride.Toyota Crown Signia's suspension consists of a MacPherson-type strut in the front and multilink rear suspension. Toyota engineers focused on reducing vibrations felt by the driver and passengers and have equipped Crown Signia's suspension with swing valve shock absorbers, a soft suspension bushing, and a dynamic damper on the front suspension. Polyurethane coated coil springs in the front help provide a smooth ride and high-damping structural adhesive on the body and reinforced seat mounting points reduces shake generated by the road.Toyota Crown Signia's handling is bolstered by an electronically controlled brake system featuring Active Cornering Assist, which engages the stability control to reduce understeer in certain cornering situations, so the driver feels the enhanced agility, not the system's operation.Creature Comfort for AllToyota Crown Signia keeps drivers and passengers plugged-in when it comes to charging devices. A vertical wireless Qi charger with charge indicator in the middle console holds a device in place while charging and maximizes space. There are also three USB-C and a 12V charging port for use in the front seat, standard. For rear seat passengers, two USB-Type C ports are standard.The front seat cup holder is designed with everyday functionality in mind. Its recessed design helps prevent drinks from spilling over to the shifter side and there is also a partition in the middle of the cup holder, maximizing its utility to fit long items like phones, tablets, and wallets. Bottle holders add storage on the front doors, along with one water bottle holder on each rear door.In the rear, passengers will enjoy the comfort and convenience of dedicated air vents, two cup holders, a rear bottle holder, and seatback pockets standard. Cargo space is abundant on Crown Signia with a rear deck that's made for an active lifestyle, including a tonneau cover and aluminum scuff plate.When there is a need for more room, the Crown Signia's 60/40 second-row fold-flat seats with extension panel are ready to accommodate cargo needs. Once folded flat, the cargo area becomes a six-and-a-half-foot long storage area, ready to accommodate items like skis, golf clubs, or luggage. The rear power liftgate allows for hands-free operation, and an easy-to-use rear seat release can be accessed from rear liftgate opening.Connected ServicesThe Toyota Crown Signia comes with a variety of connected service capabilities and trials:Drive Connect*: Includes one-year trial subscription of Cloud Navigation with Google Points of Interest (POI) data, Intelligent Assistant with Hey, Toyota, and Destination Assist.Service Connect*: Includes up to 10-year trial subscription with personalized maintenance updates and vehicle health reports.Safety Connect*: Includes up to 10-year trial subscription with Emergency Assistance, Enhanced Roadside Assistance, Automatic Collision Notification and Stolen Vehicle Locator.Wi-Fi Connect*: Includes up-to a 30-day or 3GB trial (whichever comes first) with AT&amp;T Wi-Fi hotspot and Integrated Streaming Apple Music® and Amazon Music compatibility; Integrated Streaming requires separate subscriptions to third-party provider services.Remote Connect*: Includes 1-year trial subscription; Remotely interact with your vehicle through the Toyota app via your mobile phone or smartwatch.

"Vehicle manufacturer Toyota is set to end its massive sponsorship deal with the International Olympic Committee after this year's Paris Olympics, according to reports in Japan.Toyota has a contract through the 2024 Paris Games, which was reported to be valued at $835 million when it was announced in 2015. It included four Olympics beginning with the Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Games in South Korea and ran through Paris.It has been widely reported to be the IOC's largest sponsorship deal.Citing ""sources close to the matter,"" Japanese news agency Kyodo said Toyota was unhappy the way sponsorship money was used by the IOC. The news agency, quoting the sources, said the money was ""not used effectively to support athletes and promote sports.""Reached by the Associated Press, Toyota declined to comment and said financial details were private.Toyota pulled its Olympic advertising in Japan during the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Games in 2021. It said it was responding to strong public sentiment in the country against staging the Olympics and the IOC's push to hold them.The IOC did not comment on the reports when contacted by AP.""We have an agreement with Toyota until the Olympic Games Paris 2024,"" the IOC said. ""We continue to work closely together in preparation for Paris and we look forward to bringing these plans to life.""Toyota is supplying 3,000 fuel-cell vehicles for the Paris Games to show off its green technology.The IOC generates 91% of its income from selling broadcast rights (61%) and sponsorships (30%).The IOC had income of $7.6 billion in the last four-year cycle ending with the Tokyo Games. The IOC's 15 so-called TOP sponsors paid over $2 billion in that period. The figure is expected to reach $3 billion in the next cycle.""There's no sports property that touches as many bases as the Olympics in truly every country,"" Rick Burton, who teaches sports marketing at Syracuse University, told Associated Press. ""You have high brand recognition. You just don't have other sports properties that gives you that.""Burton said the IOC was likely to find another vehicle brand if Toyota bows out. He said the best look would be finding a replacement quickly.In addition to Toyota, the TOP sponsors are: ABInBev, Airbnb, Alibaba, Allianz, Atos, Bridgestone, Coca-Cola, Deloitte, Intel, Omega, Panasonic, P&amp;G, Samsung, and Visa.Japan officially spent $13 billion on the Tokyo Olympics, at least half of which was public money. A government audit suggested the real cost was twice that. The IOC contribution was about $1.8 billion.The Tokyo Games were mired in corruption scandals linked to local sponsorships and the awarding of contracts. Dentsu Inc, the huge Japanese marketing and public-relations company, was the marketing arm of the Tokyo Olympics and raised a record-$3.3 billion in local sponsorship money. This is separate from TOP sponsors.French prosecutors also looked into alleged vote-buying in the IOC's decision in 2013 to pick Tokyo as the host for the Olympics.Copyright (c) 2024 Independent.co.uk",2024-06-04,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240527:nNRAssgnnb:16,Toyota,sustainability

Toyota Motor Corporation, Subaru Corporation and Mazda Motor Corporation have agreed to collaborate in the development of ""new engines tailored to electrification and the pursuit of carbon neutrality"".The automakers confirmed in a joint statement ""with these engines, each of the three companies will aim to optimize integration with motors, batteries and other electric drive units. While transforming vehicle packaging with more compact engines, these efforts will also decarbonize internal combustion engines (ICE) by making them compatible with various carbon-neutral fuels"", which it describes as fuels with net zero CO2 emissions across their lifecycles - from manufacture to usage. These include e-fuels such as liquid hydrogen, synthetic fuels and biofuels derived from biomass.The three automakers said they ""have been always been driven by a deep understanding of their customers' diverse lifestyles, which they say has led them to develop signature engines such as Subaru's horizontally-opposed engine, Toyota's inline-four engine and Mazda's rotary engine.With this latest collaboration the partners aim to develop next generation engines that not only improve standalone engine performance but also optimize their integration within electrified powertrains. This will allow them to develop more compact powertrains, which will help them improve overall vehicle design including aerodynamic performance.Toyota's CEO Koji Sato confirmed in a statement ""in order to provide our customers with diverse options to achieve carbon neutrality, it is necessary to take on the challenge of evolving engines that are in tune with the energy environment of the future. The three companies, which share the same aspirations, will refine engine technologies through friendly competition"".Subaru's CEO Atsushi Osaki said ""achieving a carbon-neutral society is a challenge that must be undertaken by all of Japan's industries and society as a whole. As we continue to refine electrification technology, we will also enhance our horizontally-opposed engines with an aim to use carbon-neutral fuels in the future. Moving forward, the three companies sharing the same aspiration will continue to advance the pursuit of sustainable excellence in Japanese car manufacturing"".Mazda's CEO Masahiro Moro added ""we will continue to offer customers exciting cars by honing internal combustion engines for the electrification era and expanding the multi-pathway possibilities for achieving carbon neutrality. Given the rotary engine's compatibility with electrification and carbon-neutral fuels, Mazda will continue to develop the technology through co-creation and competition to ensure it can contribute broadly to society"".Copyright © 2024 MarketLine",2024-05-29,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240529:nNRAstgzfq:1,Toyota,sustainability

(Toyota), guided by its ""Empact"" vision to address equitable EV charging and mobility for all, today announced the first communities that will receive DC fast chargers (DCFC): Baldwin Park, Calif., and Sacramento, Calif. High-power 350kW chargers at each location are to be installed, owned and operated by EVgo, one of the nation's largest public fast charging networks, and feature simultaneous charging. The California sites are targeted to be operational in 2025.""Providing 'Mobility for All' is our north star as we look to support and facilitate equitable EV charging opportunities for all customers,"" said Christopher Yang, group vice president, Business Development, Toyota Motor North America. ""We want to help ensure these underserved communities are not overlooked in the EV transition, and providing support for these charging facilities helps provide access to those who may not have easy access to home or public charging options.""Toyota's Clean Assist program, launched in 2021, matches residential customer charging with renewable electricity, thereby helping to reduce emissions generated from charging. In California this generates revenue from the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), based on battery electric vehicles (BEV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) charging at home. That revenue has been re-invested into transportation electrification in the state, including these chargers.  ""Expanding access to public charging infrastructure is critical to our mission of accelerating the mass adoption of EVs,"" said Dennis Kish, President of EVgo. ""We are proud to partner with Toyota to build new fast charging resources that will support the equitable distribution of charging infrastructure in the Golden State.""The cities receiving DC fast chargers were chosen using the CalEnviroScreen tool and based on certain criteria such as resident income levels, demographics, air quality levels, and areas that have or are expected to have meaningful EV penetration. Baldwin Park and Sacramento are both great examples of areas that are poised to see rapid EV growth in the future. These two environmental justice communities would benefit from the addition of more DC fast charging stations in strategic locations to serve the local population and support EV drivers.For example, in Sacramento, the new 350kW DC fast chargers will be installed near the Arden Fair Mall, a known high-traffic area close to the freeway with multiple options for dining, shopping and other activities.""As a member of the California Air Resources Board and the Sacramento Air Quality Management District, I am extremely excited that Toyota and EVgo have selected Arden Fair Mall as the site for a new 8-stall electric vehicle charging station,"" Councilmember Eric Guerra said. ""We'll continue to look for ways to reduce carbon emissions and I'm proud of the work our region is doing to meet our air quality goals.""The Baldwin Park charging station will also be centrally located less than a mile off Interstate 10, with access to amenities including a grocery store on site and many nearby restaurants.""Investing in public charging not only supports EV drivers, it also benefits everyone in our community by encouraging zero emissions travel in an area that has experienced historically poor air quality,"" said Senator Susan Rubio. ""This new fast charging station in Baldwin Park will bring economic and public health benefits that our residents and visitors alike can enjoy.""Toyota will look to continue supporting local communities through its Empact Vision, helping enable the transition to electrification for all, working to ensure that no one is left behind in the fight against carbon emissions.

"Toyota City, Japan, May 27, 2024 - (JCN Newswire) - Idemitsu Kosan Co., Ltd. (""Idemitsu Kosan""), ENEOS Corporation (""ENEOS""), Toyota Motor Corporation (""Toyota""), and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (""MHI"") announce that they have commenced a study toward the introduction and spread of carbon-neutral fuels that contribute to the decarbonization of automobiles with the aim of realizing a carbon-neutral society. Seeking to introduce carbon-neutral fuels in Japan around 2030, the four companies fulfilling major roles respectively in supply, technology, and demand will jointly embark on this study.About carbon-neutral fuelsCarbon-neutral fuels are fuels that limit CO2 emissions across the entire product life cycle. It is a collective term that includes synthetic fuels (e-fuel) made using hydrogen and CO2, and biofuels made from raw materials such as plants that absorb CO2 via photosynthesis. Liquid carbon-neutral fuels in particular are advantageous in terms of energy storage and transportation and are suitable as energy sources that can be transported.Scope of joint study by the four companiesDiscuss and study scenarios and roadmaps for the introduction of carbon-neutral fuels in Japan's automobile market and the various systems necessary for market introduction
Investigate the feasibility of production from perspectives such as energy security in Japan""Shaping Change"" is Idemitsu Kosan's Vision for 2050, and based on this vision, it is working on the social implementation of a steady supply of diverse, eco-friendly ""Energy one step ahead"" that forms one of the three business domains stated in its Medium-term Management Plan. As part of this effort, it is seeking the early introduction and spread of carbon-neutral fuels―synthetic fuels and biofuels―while collaborating with various companies within and outside Japan.ENEOS stated in its Group's Long-Term Vision that it will take on the challenge of achieving both a stable supply of energy and materials and the realization of a carbon-neutral society. It is undertaking various initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including using hydrogen and renewable energy and carrying out business development of carbon-neutral fuels such as synthetic fuels.Centered on a multi-pathway approach, Toyota is working toward carbon neutrality not just through the spread of electrified vehicles, but also by reducing the CO2 emissions of internal combustion engine vehicles. In 2007, it introduced flex-fuel vehicles (vehicles that can run on both biofuels and gasoline) in Brazil. Going forward, it will continue to work on reducing the CO2 emissions of internal combustion engine vehicles, including existing vehicles, and will also consider the development of engines specifically designed for electrified vehicles that contribute to the spread of carbon-neutral fuels.MHI Group has made our 2040 carbon neutrality declaration ""MISSION NET ZERO"" and is actively working to build a CO2 solutions ecosystem and a hydrogen solutions ecosystem. Through MHI group products, technologies, and services that help reduce CO2 emissions, as well as new solutions and innovations to be developed with partners around the world, we will contribute to realizing a carbon neutral society.Collaboration and partnership across industries are essential for the spread of carbon-neutral fuels toward the realization of a carbon-neutral society. As the first step in this direction, Idemitsu Kosan, ENEOS, Toyota and MHI will collaborate to undertake a study toward the introduction and spread of carbon-neutral fuels.Source: Toyota Motor CorporationCopyright 2024 JCN Newswire .

- FuelCell Energy and Toyota Motor North America Celebrate
- Launch of World's First 'Tri-gen' Production System at the
- Port of Long Beach

//st

  * FuelCell Energy's Tri-gen technology produces three products: renewable
electricity, renewable hydrogen, and usable water

  * Marks Toyota's first port vehicle processing facility in the world to
be powered by onsite-generated, 100 percent renewable electricity

  * Both light-duty and Class 8 heavy-duty fuel cell electric vehicles have
been fueled using Tri-gen generated renewable hydrogen

//et

     FuelCell Energy, Inc. and Toyota Motor North America, Inc. (Toyota)are
celebrating the grand opening ofthe first-of-its-kind ""Tri-gen"" systemat
the Port of Long Beach, California, today. Tri-gen uses biogas to produce
renewable electricity, renewable hydrogen, and usable water, and was built
to support the vehicle processing and distribution center for Toyota
Logistics Services (TLS) at Long Beach, Toyota's largest North American
vehicle processing facility that receives approximately 200,000 new Toyota
and Lexus vehicles annually.

     ""The goal of our collaboration with FuelCell Energy was to find
sustainable solutions for the TLS vehicle processing facility here at the
Port of Long Beach as part of our goal to remove carbon dioxide emissions
from our operations,"" said Group Vice President of Sustainability and
Regulatory Affairs at Toyota, Tom Stricker. ""This groundbreaking facility
shows that there are ways to reduce our emissions and burden on natural
resources with scalable technology based on hydrogen.""

     Thanks to FuelCell Energy's Tri-gen platform, TLS Long Beach is
Toyota's first port vehicle processing facility powered by 100 percent
on-site generated renewable electricity. FuelCell Energy's innovative fuel
cell technology uses an electrochemical process that converts directed
renewable biogas into electricity, hydrogen, and usable water with a highly
efficient, combustion-free process that emits virtually no air pollutants.

     ""Tri-gen demonstrates that hydrogen-based energy can benefit
businesses, deliver zero-emission transportation for light- and heavy-duty
vehicles, support improved air quality in local communities, reduce water
usage, and deliver immediate and long-term benefits to the environment,""
FuelCell Energy CEO and President Jason Few said. ""As a company, we are
living our purpose when we enable visionary customers like Toyota to
decarbonize their operations and harness the energy solutions offered by
hydrogenall while leaving communities with cleaner air and easing the
strain on power grids and water supplies.""

     Tri-gen produces 2.3-megawatts of renewable electricity, part of which
will be utilized by TLS Long Beach to support its operations at the port.
Excess electricity is delivered to the local utility, Southern California
Edison, under the California Bioenergy Market Adjustment Tariff (BioMAT)
program, adding a renewable, resilient, and affordable baseload electric
generation resource to the electric grid.

     Tri-gen can also produce up to 1,200 kg/day of hydrogen for the
fueling needs of Toyota's incoming light-duty fuel cell electric vehicle
(FCEV) Mirai while also supplying hydrogen to the adjacent heavy-duty
hydrogen refueling station to support TLS logistics and drayage operations
at the port. As of January 1, 2024, California's Advanced Clean Fleet
Regulation will only allow zero-emission trucks to newly register as
drayage trucks. By 2035, all drayage trucks will be required to be
zero-emission. The Tri-gen platform supports FCEV Class 8 trucks today and
is there to support on-going migration to zero emission trucks between now
and 2035. Hydrogen production can be ramped up and down based on
demand.Since completing construction last year, in January of this year
Toyota used the renewable hydrogen produced at Tri-gen to fill the first
Toyota Mirai vehicles at TLS, and in April the first heavy-duty FCEV
Kenworth T680 Class 8 truck was filled at the adjacent Shell HD filling
station using Tri-gen-produced renewable hydrogen.

     The water byproduct of hydrogen generation can produce up to 1,400
gallons of usable water per day, which is being repurposed for TLScar wash
operations for vehicles that come into port before customer delivery. This
helps reduce the demand on the constrained local water supplies by
approximately half a million gallons per year.

     Supporting Port of Long Beach Initiatives

     By supporting TLS operations at the Port of Long Beach, Tri-gen is
expected to help reduce more than 9,000 tons of CO emissions from the power
grid each year. This supports both Toyota Logistics Services' carbon
reduction goals as well as the Port of Long Beach's goals as a leader in
innovative solutions to reducing carbon emissions.

     ""The dawn of the renewable hydrogen era is upon us, thanks to our
collaboration with Toyota andFuelCell Energy and their innovative Tri-gen
system,"" said Port of Long Beach CEO Mario Cordero. ""The green power
generated by the Tri-gen system, and similar projects, is part of our
multi-layered strategy to fuel our goal to become the world's first
zero-emissions Port.""

     Tri-gen will also help avoid more than six tons of grid NOx emissions,
which are harmful to both people and the environment today. Using
hydrogen-powered fuel cell Class 8 trucks in port operations has the
potential to reduce diesel consumption by more than 420,000 gallons per
year.

     ""FuelCell Energy and Toyota's collaborative effort signifies
technological innovation and also positions Long Beach at the forefront of
global leadership in renewable energy solutions,"" said Long Beach Mayor
Rex Richardson. ""This transformative initiative solidifies our city's
status as a trailblazer in green initiatives and shows our dedication to a
cleaner, more sustainable future for our community and beyond.""

""The work done there, along with green hydrogen initiatives throughout the state, is propelling California toward a dynamic, clean-energy economy which will also reduce carbon emissions and foster environmental stewardship while extending California's leadership in this important space.""Construction has begun on a flexible microgrid that features energy sources available today, including a 230-kW solar photovoltaic system, a 1-MW stationary proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell generator, 325-kW solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), and an onsite 500-kWh battery energy storage system. The microgrid is designed to support the campus' energy needs, allowing it the ability to operate off-grid. The system is expected to be fully operational by 2026.""California has ambitious goals to achieve clean air, carbon neutrality and a vibrant economy. Toyota's investment to expand their research and development of hydrogen fuel cell technology in our state is an example of the innovation that will accelerate the development and deployment of zero-emissions transportation options, particularly as we decarbonize the goods movement sector,"" said CARB Chair Liane Randolph.In the future, Toyota's plans for the new North American Hydrogen HQ will include a sustainable education center, available for tours by reservation. The center will be a place for people to learn more about Toyota's vision of sustainability and the role that hydrogen will play.30+ Years of DevelopmentFrom creating one of the world's first mass market passenger fuel cell electric vehicles in the Mirai, to applying and scaling the technology now to other applications that can benefit from zero-emissions, including heavy-duty transport, power generation systems, and others, Toyota's research and development with hydrogen fuel cell technology spans more than 30 years.For much of that time, the Gardena office supported or initiated a wide range of fuel cell electric projects. To share some recent examples, the Fuel Cell Development (FCD) team was instrumental in supporting the development of Toyota's light-duty Mirai, launched back in 2015, and the team collaborated with industry partners to help support infrastructure growth through the state of California.In 2017, to address decarbonization efforts at local ports, Toyota's FCD team helped prove the scalability of fuel cell technology after it acquired a Class 8 truck and fitted it with a fuel cell electric powertrain consisting of two Mirai fuel-cell stacks. This effort then led to a collaboration with PACCAR's Kenworth brand to build 10 proof-of-concept trucks, trucks used to support the ""Shore to Store"" ZANZEFF project that proved the viability of hydrogen-powered fuel cells as a zero-emission powertrain in heavy-duty applications. PACCAR and Toyota later agreed in 2023 to pursue commercialization of the project, with Toyota supplying the fuel cell powertrain kits from its Kentucky plant as a Tier 1 supplier.Most recently, Toyota has demonstrated a non-automotive opportunity for hydrogen-powered fuel cell technology in stationary power generation. Toyota and TRD partnered to build a stationary unit to provide electricity at events where it was not readily available, launching the first public activation at an LPGA Tour stop where the unit supported the power needs of the event stage and sound system. The solution provided clean, quiet power that was proven to capably replace traditional diesel generators. Last year, Toyota built a 1MW fuel cell electric generator for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado to support microgrid testing at the facility. And finally, earlier this year, Toyota collaborated with Kohler on a prototype stationary generator to provide backup emergency power for Klickitat Valley Health hospital in Goldendale, Washington.About ToyotaToyota (NYSE:TM) has been a part of the cultural fabric in North America for more than 65 years, and is committed to advancing sustainable, next-generation mobility through our Toyota and Lexus brands, plus our more than 1,800 dealerships.Toyota directly employs more than 63,000 people in North America who have contributed to the design, engineering, and assembly of nearly 47 million cars and trucks at our 13 manufacturing plants. By 2025, Toyota's 14th plant in North Carolina will begin to manufacture automotive batteries for electrified vehicles. With more electrified vehicles on the road than any other automaker, Toyota currently offers 27 electrified options.For more information about Toyota, visit www.ToyotaNewsroom.com.Media ContactJoshua BurnsJoshua.Burns@Toyota.com  View original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/toyota-establishes-hydrogen-headquarters-to-accelerate-advancement-of-fuel-cell-technology-302132596.htmlSOURCE  Toyota Motor North AmericaCopyright (c) 2024 PR Newswire Association,LLC.

"Zuber Issa has ended his partnership in Asda with brother Mohsin, selling his stake in a deal that gives private equity firm TDR Capital full control of the supermarket chain.The move brings TDR Capital's share to 67.5 per cent, while 22.5 per cent is still owned by Mohsin. The supermarket is currently hunting for a new chief executive to help stem falling market share.The billionaire brothers from Blackburn bought Asda from Walmart in 2020 for £6.8bn with the backing of TDR Capital. Walmart still holds a 10 per cent stake.But there have been reports of a rift in their relationship.Zuber Issa said he would now ""spend more time on my charitable endeavours"" and has bought the UK petrol forecourt business from the brothers' EG Group. That deal means he will also step down as co-chief executive of EG Group, so Mohsin will become sole chief executive.However, the GMB union said the deal would spell bad news for shoppers and staff, accusing TDR Capital of ""asset-stripping"" at the supermarket.The union has previously claimed the owners slashed an estimated 8 million staff hours from the shop floor in the business to boost profits. Asda denied the claims at the time, pointing to investment in stores and the launch of the supermarket's loyalty app, Asda Rewards, as evidence that the company is growing.Nadine Houghton, GMB national officer, said: ""TDR Capital have serious questions to answer about their asset-stripping of Asda.""Their private equity ownership has already been bad for consumers – with Asda now the most expensive retailer for fuel – and bad for staff, with millions of working hours cut from the shop floor.""Further involvement from TDR can only spell more bad news. Bosses must change course to protect Asda workers and stop this British retailer further losing more market share.""Zuber Issa said: ""With the divestment of my Asda shares, I will now turn my attention towards leading and managing the remaining EG UK forecourt sites that I have personally acquired, and spend more time on my charitable endeavours.""I am pleased to see TDR increasing its investment in Asda. With Mohsin and TDR's ongoing focus and shareholding, I am confident that Asda will achieve its growth ambitions.""Gary Lindsay and Tom Mitchell, managing partners of TDR Capital, said: ""We first invested into Asda over three years ago, seeing a huge opportunity to cement its position as one of the UK's leading retail brands.""""As majority owners, we will continue to work closely with the Asda management team and colleagues across the business to support the ambitious strategy, which we believe is the right one to continue to move Asda forward.""Meanwhile, Asda continues its hunt for a chief executive after Mohsin Issa handed over the running of the supermarket as part of a revamp of the chain.Bosses must change course to protect Asda workers and stop this British retailer further losing more market shareNadine Houghton, GMBMohsin said earlier this year that he was carrying out a ""reset"" of the company before hiring a new chief.In April, Asda revealed its underlying earnings swelled by a quarter last year with growth in food and clothing sales.Asda was named Britain's most expensive supermarket fuel retailer earlier this week, according to RAC analysis.

With a shared set of values, the two businesses have come together, as partners in change. According to WRAP, the climate action NGO, in the UK alone, 1.6 billion items of clothing in our wardrobes aren't being worn - which is an average of 31 items per person. The 'M&amp;S fixed by SOJO' hub - launching in August - will support M&amp;S customers to give their M&amp;S clothes 'Another life.' and reduce textile waste, a key pillar of the retailer's Plan A roadmap to drive the circular economy. The partnership builds on the retailers established clothes donation scheme with Oxfam, which has collected over 36 million items of clothing raising an estimated £23m to tackle poverty around the world. Giving clothes Another life. Through a dedicated online hub, M&amp;S customers will be able to select and book a range of bespoke repair services - from zip replacements to invisible knitwear mending - all through one simple online form.

UK retailer Marks and Spencer (M&amp;S) tells Just Style it is not currently selling any alpaca wool products but it has updated its policy following a ""careful review of updated industry standards"" as PETA calls the move a ""slap in the face"".M&amp;S told Just Style its review had reassured the company that it could reintroduce alpaca wool in the future, knowing that its ""strict animal welfare requirements would be met"".M&amp;S is referring to the Responsible Alpaca Standard (RAS), which the Textile Exchange launched in 2021. The standard aims to verify and identify alpaca fibre produced in farming systems that respect animal welfare and the environment.In 2020, M&amp;S announced it would ""phase out"" use of alpaca wool in future product development following an investigation by animal rights group PETA into the world's largest privately-owned alpaca farm in Peru, Mallkini.The exposé showed workers holding struggling baby alpacas who were shorn with electric clippers, leaving the animals bleeding from deep wounds.Other fashion brands which stopped their use of alpaca wool at the time included Next, New Look, Matalan and Ted Baker, amongst others.PETA's vice president for the UK, Europe and Australia Mimi Bekhechi called M&amp;S' decision ""a slap in the face to compassionate consumers"".""Unless it changes its mind, customers will turn their backs on M&amp;S - just as it has turned its back on animals and sold out to bogus wool industry standard schemes,"" Bekhechi told Just Style.""If M&amp;S wants to stay on the high street and in the good graces of today's conscientious shoppers, it must take the high road and ban alpaca wool - and all animal-derived clothing and accessories - from its stores. And that's exactly what PETA is calling on it to do.""The Textile Exchange told Just Style that it ""recognised the role of animal rights organisations in pushing for change in the fashion industry"" and said its RAS was designed to incentivise the humane treatment of animals.""For the industry to meet its climate and nature goals including the reduction of greenhouse gas emission by 45%, while creating beneficial impacts for animals, people and planet, the industry needs a diverse portfolio of preferred fibres and a reduction in new synthetic materials.""So, while animal rights organisations often hold the position that animal fibres being used for human purposes is unacceptable, we believe that animal-derived materials should only be used if, and when measures can be taken to prevent unnecessary harm to animals.""In 2023, PETA, asked Swedish fashion retailer H&amp;M to produce a report detailing how it sources duck down following claims that inhumane slaughter methods were used by a previous duck down supplier.Copyright © 2024 MarketLine",2024-06-21,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240621:nNRAt1i8a1:1,Marks & Spencer,esg

Today, the small but growing team is made up of tailors, riders, developers and creatives working to accelerate change in the fashion industry. With a shared set of values, the two businesses have come together, as partners in change. According to WRAP, the climate action NGO, in the UK alone, 1.6 billion items of clothing in our wardrobes aren't being worn - which is an average of 31 items per person. The 'M&amp;S fixed by SOJO' hub - launching in August - will support M&amp;S customers to give their M&amp;S clothes 'Another life.' and reduce textile waste, a key pillar of the retailer's Plan A roadmap to drive the circular economy. The partnership builds on the retailers established clothes donation scheme with Oxfam, which has collected over 36 million items of clothing raising an estimated £23m to tackle poverty around the world. Giving clothes Another life. Through a dedicated online hub, M&amp;S customers will be able to select and book a range of bespoke repair services - from zip replacements to invisible knitwear mending - all through one simple online form. With repairs starting from just £5, M&amp;S clothing can be sent, repaired by SOJOs in-house repair team and returned directly to the customers doorstep within seven to 10 days.  The partnership with SOJO comes as M&amp;S reveals 'Another life.' Visible across the retailer's, website, app and stores from this month, Plan A - 'Another life.' brings together all the retailer's circularity services into one place. From the new partnership with SOJO, Beauty Takeback Scheme with Handle to its long-running clothes donation partnership with Oxfam, which was formerly known as 'Shwopping', all initiatives now sit together as part of Plan A - 'Another Life.' to offer a more seamless experience for customers who are looking for ways they can support a shift to a more circular economy. As well as a range of services, the Plan A - 'Another life.' platform will be home to a selection of 60 second 'how to' videos covering everything from debobbling knitwear to adjusting hemlines - created by M&amp;S' team of in-house technical experts.  Plan A, because there is no Plan B Last week, M&amp;S published its annual ESG Report 2024** revealing the progress made to date on its Plan A roadmap. Looking ahead, the retailer is continuing to find new ways to reduce textile waste to drive the circular economy.  The new partnership with SOJO is supported by M&amp;S' Plan A Accelerator Fund which aims to take rapid action to climate change through a series of innovation projects. Earlier this year, the fund was used to support an online postal trial with Oxfam which enabled customers to donate their unwearable - but too good to waste - clothing, alongside their pre-loved wearable clothing directly to Oxfam to be resold, reused, or recycled.  Richard Price, Managing Director of Clothing &amp; Home at M&amp;S, commented: ""At M&amp;S, exceptional quality products are at the heart of everything we do, and we want to ensure that all our clothes are too good to waste. Through the launch of our repair service, we're making it even easier for customers to give their clothes Another life, whether they are using our new repair service or long-standing clothes recycling scheme.""  Josephine Phillips, Founder and CEO of SOJO, commented: ""It has always been a core mission of ours at SOJO to make repairing clothes mainstream and to extend the life of as many garments as possible.

UK retailer Marks and Spencer (M&amp;S) tells Just Style it is not currently selling any alpaca wool products but it has updated its policy following a ""careful review of updated industry standards"" as PETA calls the move a ""slap in the face"".M&amp;S told Just Style its review had reassured the company that it could reintroduce alpaca wool in the future, knowing that its ""strict animal welfare requirements would be met"".M&amp;S is referring to the Responsible Alpaca Standard (RAS), which the Textile Exchange launched in 2021. The standard aims to verify and identify alpaca fibre produced in farming systems that respect animal welfare and the environment.In 2020, M&amp;S announced it would ""phase out"" use of alpaca wool in future product development following an investigation by animal rights group PETA into the world's largest privately-owned alpaca farm in Peru, Mallkini.The exposé showed workers holding struggling baby alpacas who were shorn with electric clippers, leaving the animals bleeding from deep wounds.Other fashion brands which stopped their use of alpaca wool at the time included Next, New Look, Matalan and Ted Baker, amongst others.PETA's vice president for the UK, Europe and Australia Mimi Bekhechi called M&amp;S' decision ""a slap in the face to compassionate consumers"".""Unless it changes its mind, customers will turn their backs on M&amp;S - just as it has turned its back on animals and sold out to bogus wool industry standard schemes,"" Bekhechi told Just Style.""If M&amp;S wants to stay on the high street and in the good graces of today's conscientious shoppers, it must take the high road and ban alpaca wool - and all animal-derived clothing and accessories - from its stores. And that's exactly what PETA is calling on it to do.""The Textile Exchange told Just Style that it ""recognised the role of animal rights organisations in pushing for change in the fashion industry"" and said its RAS was designed to incentivise the humane treatment of animals.""For the industry to meet its climate and nature goals including the reduction of greenhouse gas emission by 45%, while creating beneficial impacts for animals, people and planet, the industry needs a diverse portfolio of preferred fibres and a reduction in new synthetic materials.""So, while animal rights organisations often hold the position that animal fibres being used for human purposes is unacceptable, we believe that animal-derived materials should only be used if, and when measures can be taken to prevent unnecessary harm to animals.""In 2023, PETA, asked Swedish fashion retailer H&amp;M to produce a report detailing how it sources duck down following claims that inhumane slaughter methods were used by a previous duck down supplier.Copyright © 2024 MarketLine",2024-06-21,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240621:nNRAt1i8a1:1,Marks & Spencer,environment

"Jul 16, 2024Investors interested in stocks from the Retail - Supermarkets sector have probably already heard of Marks and Spencer Group PLC (MAKSY) and Walmart (WMT). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Both Marks and Spencer Group PLC and Walmart have a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.MAKSY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.98, while WMT has a forward P/E of 28.70. We also note that MAKSY has a PEG ratio of 0.72. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. WMT currently has a PEG ratio of 4.01.Another notable valuation metric for MAKSY is its P/B ratio of 2.22. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, WMT has a P/B of 6.37.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to MAKSY's Value grade of A and WMT's Value grade of C.Both MAKSY and WMT are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that MAKSY is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Description: Britain's Ocado lifted the annual profit margin guidance for its key warehouse technology division on Tuesday (July 16), reassuring investors and prompting a recovery in its battered shares. Francis Maguire reports.

Video Transcript:
Ocado shares jumped as much as 15% on Tuesday. Investors were cheered after the food delivery firm lifted guidance for its key warehouse technology division. Ocado runs an online supermarket in the UK through a joint venture with Marks &amp; Spencer. It also sells cutting-edge warehouse technology to retailers around the world. Before Tuesday's update, shares had slumped by more than half this year. The market was concerned by a slowdown in the rollout of robotic sites and modules for its retail partners. CEO Tim Steiner said Ocado was talking to potential new partners and had a strong pipeline of interest. He added Ocado did not need to raise additional capital, pointing to liquidity of more than $1.30 billion. Ocado said it now expects its technology solutions division to achieve a mid-teens earnings margin before tax in the 2023-2024 year, up from previous guidance of 10%. It forecast underlying cash flow would improve by $194.4 million, again up on previous outlooks. The firm's pretax loss narrowed to just under $200 million from $376 million. Ocado also said it was on track to be profitable at the pretax level in four to five years.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

Elections in major markets raise questions for European investors. Welcome to Market Insight. I am Thomas Warner. France's left-wing alliance became the largest group in a hung parliament over the weekend, just days after a landslide win for Britain's Labour Party. Britain's new PM and his ministers have been out and about ever since Thursday, laying out their plans for the next five years. But the situation in France looks far more complicated. With me to help make sense of its all is Russ Mould. He is the Investment Director at AJ Bell. And a very warm welcome to you, Russ, very good of you to give up your time to come and talk to us today. Now, turning to France, we have potentially got weeks of parliamentary horse-trading to come. And so far, there does seem to be little sign of any concern at all in the equity markets. Is it the calm before the storm, do you think, Russ?
That is a good question, right? Equity markets were braced for a very difficult result, and they certainly got that last weekend, and I think the summary for the results of the second round is not ideal, could have been worse. Worst news probably already priced in, so I think that is why the equity market is taking it quite calmly. The Euro was currently holding firm. And although the cost of French government borrowing is above average relative to the German government cost of borrowing, it is within historic limits and actually not moving up to sharply today. So, again, currency, bond, stock markets all relatively calm. And I think, again, the result could have been worse but much works still to be done. We have a very difficult negotiation for a coalition to come up. France's debts are way above the levels that are acceptable to the Maastricht Treaty. And the new government itself has got some very aggressive spending, or the biggest party has got aggressive spending plans of its own, so much work still to be done.
Let us look at the UK now. The new Finance Minister, Rachel Reeves, was laying out plans this morning to kick start homebuilding. Once again though, Russ, the stock markets did not really react. Why was that, do you think?
The homebuilders have actually had a very good run in the weeks leading up to the election, again in the view that Labour would win and win handily, which they did. And that some supply-side reforms involving planning, and housing, and renewables, and infrastructure would be big forefronts of any Labour economic plan. So, again, largely expected there. So, the builders having already had a good run, saying, ""Well, fine, we kind of know all this."". I think Rachel Reeves, the new Finance Minister, is now saying, ""We are going to carry out thorough Treasury spending review. We are going to get the Office for Budget Responsibility prepare some new economic growth forecasts. And we will prioritize growth when we come to the autumn budget."" I think now all eyes will move onto that financial statement when it comes.
You have obviously been speaking to people all morning about this- particularly this address from Rachel Reeves. So, what sort of reaction have you been getting from people out there?
Again, it is a very similar reaction to the French situation. I guess there is probably more comfort in that Labour does have a ""thumping"" majority and will be easily able to pass any legislation it chooses to. And also, the lessons of ""Trussonomics"" and the accident that befell the British economy under the Conservative government in 2022 is being seen by financial market participants as a warning sign that Labour will not do anything too aggressive on tax and spending, certainly at least initially. Equally, markets do seem quite pleased with the Labour Party's focus on growth, because that is what is really needed to help the UK shake off its debt, is growth. And there is not an awful lot of fiscal room for maneuver simple because debt to GDP is so high, so it is a fitting that their policy seem sensible and prudent. And as long as if there is extra borrowing, it is for productive investment rather than just welfare payments, markets for the moment at least would be relatively calm.
Well, there has been one stock that has been lighting up the FTSE today, Russ, that is Britvic. It has agreed to a takeover from Carlsberg at the third time of asking. Who has got the better end of that deal, do you think?
Yes, it is interesting. Normally, you see one share price go up and one share price go down when a big deal is done, on the grounds that somebody is getting a good price and somebody is getting a bad one. Both shares are up today. Britvic to near the big price level to suggest that investors now feel confident it will go through. I think Carlsberg investors were initially quite nervous. But now that PepsiCo was giving its blessing for the deal, because Britvic is a big bottling agent for them, I think that has eased one major obstacle, and they have not raised their bid price too much for their initial offers, so maybe both sides will win. And Carlsberg looking to diversify, maybe appeal to younger generation who do not drink quite so much beer and drink softer drinks instead.
Well, there is one country in Europe where they will never give up their love of beer. I think that is Germany. And we have had a big story over there today, is the online takeaway firm Delivery Hero, Russ, down heavily after revealing that it might be facing a EUR400 million fine for antitrust violations. What is your understanding of they are in trouble for? And how material of a fine do you think that might be for them?
Yes, I mean, management have already put away a provision of EUR189 million because this investigation by the European Commission has been running since 2022 when their offices were raided. The company has been accused of anticompetitive practice, information sharing, for example with rivals which may- I guess, they are able to decide who addresses which markets, how much they charge, I guess, the potential implications of that. The fine of more than EUR400 million, which management is now expecting, well, ironically, Delivery Hero is expected get into profit for the first time this year at the operating level. And that is at around EUR200 million level, so more than double they made and never profit. It is not an insignificant sum, it is quite a big hit. And that is why the shares are down to almost fresh multi-year lows today as a result on the Frankfurt exchange.
Just finally, Russ, I am going to ask you about Ocado. They have signed a deal and have announced today. They are going to be building a third robotic warehouse over in Japan. They obviously dropped out of the FTSE 100 a couple of weeks ago. Shares are down by half since January. What do you make of Tim Steiner's efforts to turn things around over there?
I mean, the shares reached a seven-year low, and so the issue whether Ocado is on the right track and how much Mr. Steiner is paid, they are always going to be bubbling around there. But at least this is some good news for the company with this third warehousing facility in Japan after North American partner Sobeys in Canada declined to add to I think a fifth facility in its rollup and made sure that it was no longer exclusive so Ocado could perhaps look for other partners in the USA and Canada. So, the model for Ocado, it is still losing money in food delivery with the joint venture with Marks &amp; Spencer here in the UK. It is trying to turn itself into this technology software company and investors have been very, very patient and waiting for that to turn into a profit. The more partners they have, the more warehouses roll out, the better, but it still yet to prove itself and that is why their shares have been finding it pretty tough going this year.
Investment Director at AJ Bell, Russ Mould, many thanks indeed for your thoughts today. And that is Market Insight.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

Today, the small but growing team is made up of tailors, riders, developers and creatives working to accelerate change in the fashion industry. With a shared set of values, the two businesses have come together, as partners in change. According to WRAP, the climate action NGO, in the UK alone, 1.6 billion items of clothing in our wardrobes aren't being worn - which is an average of 31 items per person. The 'M&amp;S fixed by SOJO' hub - launching in August - will support M&amp;S customers to give their M&amp;S clothes 'Another life.' and reduce textile waste, a key pillar of the retailer's Plan A roadmap to drive the circular economy. The partnership builds on the retailers established clothes donation scheme with Oxfam, which has collected over 36 million items of clothing raising an estimated £23m to tackle poverty around the world. Giving clothes Another life. Through a dedicated online hub, M&amp;S customers will be able to select and book a range of bespoke repair services - from zip replacements to invisible knitwear mending - all through one simple online form. With repairs starting from just £5, M&amp;S clothing can be sent, repaired by SOJOs in-house repair team and returned directly to the customers doorstep within seven to 10 days.  The partnership with SOJO comes as M&amp;S reveals 'Another life.' Visible across the retailer's, website, app and stores from this month, Plan A - 'Another life.' brings together all the retailer's circularity services into one place. From the new partnership with SOJO, Beauty Takeback Scheme with Handle to its long-running clothes donation partnership with Oxfam, which was formerly known as 'Shwopping', all initiatives now sit together as part of Plan A - 'Another Life.' to offer a more seamless experience for customers who are looking for ways they can support a shift to a more circular economy. As well as a range of services, the Plan A - 'Another life.' platform will be home to a selection of 60 second 'how to' videos covering everything from debobbling knitwear to adjusting hemlines - created by M&amp;S' team of in-house technical experts.  Plan A, because there is no Plan B Last week, M&amp;S published its annual ESG Report 2024** revealing the progress made to date on its Plan A roadmap. Looking ahead, the retailer is continuing to find new ways to reduce textile waste to drive the circular economy.  The new partnership with SOJO is supported by M&amp;S' Plan A Accelerator Fund which aims to take rapid action to climate change through a series of innovation projects. Earlier this year, the fund was used to support an online postal trial with Oxfam which enabled customers to donate their unwearable - but too good to waste - clothing, alongside their pre-loved wearable clothing directly to Oxfam to be resold, reused, or recycled.  Richard Price, Managing Director of Clothing &amp; Home at M&amp;S, commented: ""At M&amp;S, exceptional quality products are at the heart of everything we do, and we want to ensure that all our clothes are too good to waste. Through the launch of our repair service, we're making it even easier for customers to give their clothes Another life, whether they are using our new repair service or long-standing clothes recycling scheme.""  Josephine Phillips, Founder and CEO of SOJO, commented: ""It has always been a core mission of ours at SOJO to make repairing clothes mainstream and to extend the life of as many garments as possible. I'm so excited that M&amp;S has chosen to launch a repair service with us at SOJO as it's an incredibly big step towards that mission. As a brand that has remained a firm constant in almost every household and wardrobe in Britain, this partnership with truly bring easy, accessible and convenient repairs to the masses. Beyond that, as one of the longest standing British brands, having M&amp;S join our Pledge to Repair adds such a great weight to our call for industry-wide change here in the UK."" Copyright © 2024 MarketLine",2024-07-04,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240704:nNRAt5t5iq:1,Marks & Spencer,social

"Archie Norman's first attempt, a year ago, to reinvent the annual shareholder meeting for the digital age suffered from an enormous error. In designing the event as digital-only – in other words, in telling shareholders not to turn up in person and to tune in online instead – the chair of Marks &amp; Spencer abused the well-established principle that even small investors in a listed company must have the right, once a year, to buttonhole the bosses in the flesh. Directors cannot expect to live virtually; the pandemic is over.His second effort on Tuesday was vastly improved because it was a genuine hybrid event. Shareholders were free to ignore M&amp;S's odd advice that they would get ""the best experience"" by joining online, and 100-plus individuals were in the room at the company's headquarters in Paddington, west London. The point, let's hope, has been made: leave it up to the punters to decide how they wish to participate, which is how M&amp;S behaves in its day job as an ""omnichannel"" retailer.Yet Norman's push for greater digital access is correct at its core. To catch the attention of private shareholders – folk who everybody says are vital to the task of reviving interest in public markets – there must be a video component in the age of Zoom and Teams. Not everybody lives in London, where most meetings happen. M&amp;S's online audience was many times greater than the one in the building.One cannot say the investors were treated to scintillating content, of course. The main mini-revelation in the Q&amp;A was that the company had an astonishing 50,000 ex-employees with discount cards entitling them to 20%-off for life before the chief executive, Stuart Machin, decided the policy was absurdly generous and moved the qualifying employment period from 10 years to 25.But shareholders did get to press Norman on his cautious approach to dividends, which seemed to be their main grumble. And he and Machin were obliged to explain why M&amp;S won't guarantee to pay its contractors, as opposed to its staff, the real living wage. That is worth doing in a public forum.Broadly speaking, the hybrid format worked. It is possible to quibble with the use of a ""shareholder advocate"", in the form of broadcaster Anita Anand, to select the online questions, but a managed process does allow more ground to be covered. And an outsider is arguably better placed than the chair to cut off verbose questioners or the offensive variety (recall the appalling misogynistic comments at Aviva's meeting a couple of years ago).Other companies should take note. Attendances at annual company meetings have been in decline for years. Most boardrooms give the impression they wish the events didn't exist, whether out of fear of protesters or because they regard small investors as irrelevant. Norman is at least trying to stir interest and ""stand up for the small shareholder"", which should be applauded.A few big-name investment trusts, such as Fundsmith and Scottish Mortgage, attract healthy audiences of interested investors who ask sharp questions. There is no reason why regular companies shouldn't aim for the same thing. It would show a certain basic acceptance of the advantage of openness. More shareholders should attend, whether virtually or in person. More companies should make it worth their while.Copyright (c) 2024 theguardian.com-NonSyndicated",2024-07-02,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240702:nNRAt520ia:1,Marks & Spencer,social

"The Marks and Spencer Select Farm Awards 2024 have shone a light on the seafood processing sector, as the Emerging Talent award has been scooped by a Scottish Sea Farms processing supervisor.A Scottish Sea Farms processing supervisor has won the inaugural Emerging Talent award at the Marks and Spencer Select Farm Awards 2024. Nicole McAleer saw off competition from other leading food producers to scoop the prize, one of five awarded at the Royal Highland Show in Edinburgh, Scotland.The Emerging Talent award, open to anyone aged 35 and under, champions those who are positive role models, making an exceptional contribution to their sector.McAleer joined the salmon producer over four years ago as a trainee processing supervisor at South Shian near Oban before progressing to her current position and is believed to be one of only two women in the Scottish sector to perform such a role.Originally from Omagh in Northern Ireland, McAleer said she didn?t know what a salmon farm was when she first moved to Oban. Spending her first six months with Scottish Sea Farms learning the ropes out on the floor, she now oversees the entire South Shian processing facility, which has the capacity to process up to 140 tonnes of salmon per single shift.?Considering I had no fish background whatsoever - my dad is a chicken farmer - before working at Scottish Sea Farms, or of running a facility of any type, to be nominated by my boss, four years in, was a really good feeling,? said McAleer, in a press release.?To then go on to win the category is further recognition that I?m doing something right. It?s like a big pat on the back,? she added.Scottish Sea Farms primary processing manager Donald MacAulay, who nominated McAleer for the Emerging Talent Award, said: ?Nicole?s commitment to the job, and her appetite to learn and grow, have been instrumental in shaping the calm, capable processing supervisor that she is today.?Copyright (c) 2024 Euclid Infotech Pvt Ltd.",2024-06-27,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240627:nNRAt34ur7:1,Marks & Spencer,social
"If you really want to find the best perfume this summer, you can't just leave it to a last-minute airport job and with 2024's newest launches hitting shelves, it's time you did your research.When we think of summer scents, we typically think of citrus and aqua notes, but there's a fine line between smelling like the Algarve and smelling like the bathroom.If you want your summer perfume to transport you, look no further than Jo Love's new scent: with love from Positano. Not going abroad this summer? Jo Malone's wood, sage and sea salt will blow the cobwebs off you in the same way those Cornish cliffs will.As well as new places, these summer scents can also convey nostalgia and nothing is more nostalgic than the smell of Nivea sun cream , which has been bottled up into a perfume.Alongside your favourites, I've also included some brands you won't find in duty-free. DS &amp; Durga's Debaser has a cult following for a reason and DedCool's red Dakota proves why they are the perfume brand to watch.Keep reading for the summer scents to spritz this season.How I tested the best summer perfumesAs fresh scents aren't known for their lasting power, I wore each of these perfumes for an entire day. Spraying both my skin and my clothes to see how many hours they lasted. Some, such as Nivea sun and Jo Malone, I've worn for years, but still repeated the same process to see how they compared to newer launches.The best summer perfumes of 2024 are:Best summer perfume overall – DS &amp; Durga debaser: £155, Spacenk.comBest budget summer perfume – Nivea sun eau de toilette: £36.21, Amazon.co.ukBest gender-neutral summer perfume – Jo Malone wood sage and sea salt: £118, Lookfantastic.comBest daytime scent – Aerin Mediterranean honeysuckle: £78.75, Lookfantastic.comBest evening scent – Vyrao sun rae: £135, Spacenk.comRead MoreM&amp;S's TikTok-approved perfumes rival Chanel, Marc Jacobs and moreBella Hadid's beauty brand is finally here – how to shop the Orebella perfumeThe best perfume deals at Lookfantastic, from Marc Jacobs to Sol de JaneiroSabrina Carpenter has launched a new perfume – could it be the scent of the summer?Chanel's new perfume is inspired by the cosmos and I'm starry-eyed for itDS &amp; Durga debaserBy far the most unique summer perfume on this list and one that will make you want to explore the rest of the DS &amp; Durga line. Described as ""hot, humid and sexy"", the debaser perfume was inspired by nostalgic road trip summers around the New England Coast while listening to the Pixies on the car stereo. While my summers in Croydon recreation grounds can't relate, they can appreciate this fig scent. On first spritz, the debaser perfume immediately takes you outside with its freshness – in a green, not citrus way. It's weird to say, I know, but it almost smells wet. The sexiness comes when the fig takes over, followed by soft blonde woods and musk.It evokes that endless summer feeling. Warm nights that mean you can stay outside for hours, slightly sweaty skin (in a hot way) and maybe even the hope of a cliched fling. This deserves five stars for taking a completely different approach, but still capturing all the summer feels. Not to mention is a fresh scent that lasts on the skin to the point I could still smell it on my T-shirt the next day.Buy now £155.00, Spacenk.comNivea sun eau de toiletteNivea sun may be the cheapest on the list by far, but it's the one that truly does capture the real essence of summer. To me, it's as much a perfume, as it is a mood enhancer and come summer, I spray it with the same enthusiasm as I do my nephew's Nerf super soaker water gun.The smell is literally Nivea's signature sun cream, which is as much the scent of summer as it is a nostalgia weapon. For me, visceral memories of carefree childhood holidays come flooding back, along with images of my nan in her apartment in Malaga.To me, this perfume does get five out of five, but to you, I can't score it that way because the simple fact is, it does not last. There is zero staying power here beyond an hour's wear, which for any other £40 perfume, would be a complete fail. Thankfully, for Nivea however, the joy of spritzing this never gets old.Buy now £37.00, Amazon.co.ukJo Malone wood sage &amp; sea saltThis is somewhat of a rediscovery for me this summer and now we're reacquainted, I'm telling you, this should be a staple for everyone having a UK staycation.Perfume descriptions are often ridiculous, but Jo Malone perfectly captured wood sage and sea salt: ""Breathe in the bracing air of the British coast"". This is the ice bath of summer scents and I love to liberally spray it on those mornings when the sun is streaming in and you're eager to get out into the great outdoors.In my opinion, this is the most gender-neutral scent on this list. It holds up a good few hours – I don't mind losing a few for that freshness. I do, however, hate that it makes me rage for failing (once again) to book a summer Cornwall break.Buy now £118.00, Lookfantastic.comBvlgari allegra chill and sole eau de perfumeIf the sparkle of the sun shining on the turquoise waters of the Mediterranean had a smell, this perfume would surely be it. Newly released in 2024, Bvlgari's allegra chill and sole is so fresh that one spray makes you instantly feel lighter, brighter and airer. Even better, it's a crispness that lingers, which is rare for summer scents.The blend of neroli, lemon, orange blossom and petitgrain makes it smell as pretty as the pink and blue bottle looks and for such a fresh scent, it's fairly strong (two squirts maximum for me). Like all summer perfumes, it does lack lasting power, but it will see you through the day before requiring a top-up for your evening activities.Buy now £149.00, Harrods.comDedcool red DakotaBefore SpaceNK got its hands on it and we could finally buy the brand in the UK, I walked the streets of New York and Los Angeles, desperately hunting down DedCool's iconic xtra milk skin scent. On one of my failed attempts, I found the hand wash in red Dakota instead and honestly, I don't ever want to buy another brand again. Thankfully, red Dakota also comes in perfume form, so I no longer have to sniff my hands to get my fix.Out of all the scents on this list, this, to me, is the warmest and most comforting. That's because of the middle woody, amber notes, with the hit of summer coming before thanks to clementine and gardenia. I don't want a summer of adventure when I spray this, I want a summer of all the best parts, with none of the scariness of change that September brings. I'm talking about the holiday with your best friends where you barely leave the villa, the nights where you stay up in the garden talking till the early hours and the days where every dinner is an impromptu barbecue.Buy now £71.00, Spacenk.comBy Kilian sunkissed goddessBy Kilian is the brand best known for being Rihanna's favourite perfume, and I think you won't be disappointed with sunkissed goddess. It's exactly how I imagine a very sexy, beautifully dressed woman (with a lot of disposable income) would smell. Picture Amal Clooney getting ready for dinner in her Lake Como villa.This is a more grown-up summer scent than Bvlgari's chill and sole perfume, despite the creamy coconut and vanilla. That's because it dries down to an almost powdery finish, which cuts through the sweetness. To me, this is a real neck nuzzler of a scent. Whether you're wearing it or someone else, you keep wanting to go back for a whiff. Luckily then, this is another one on the list that has good staying power.Buy now £220.00, Cultbeauty.co.ukAerin mediterranean honeysuckleAnother scent inspired by the Mediterranean, but somehow smells completely different. I don't actually get that vibe from it, not that I'm complaining because I haven't stopped thinking about this perfume since I first sprayed it.It's described as a floral citrus, but it's the latter part I'm missing. Instead, to me, it smells like a bright, clean, fresh summer scent. Think washing that's dried on the line for once.While the grapefruit, bergamot and orange don't really come through, the honeysuckle, lily of the valley and gardenia do and that's coming from someone who is not a fan of floral scents. There is one downside, like many of these fresh scents, it only lingers for a few hours.Buy now £78.75, Lookfantastic.comVyrao sun raeIf you like a little more zing in your summer scent, and by zing I mean spice, this is the one to pick. I'd describe Vyrao's sun rae by saying it's the perfume I can picture Phoebe from Friends wearing when New York hits that summer heat. Lemon gives it an initial fresh summery scent, but there's also turmeric root, ginger, black pepper and cardamom. It's different from other citrus scents, in a spicy way.As the spiciness wears away, you're left with sandalwood, amber and musk, all giving an enveloping, beautiful warm skin smell. If you're tired of generic summer scents or want a twist on the classic citrus, this is one to add to your list.Buy now £135.00, Spacenk.comThe verdict: Summer perfumesThere's so much more to summer scents than those generic Noughties coconut ones I grew up with – I love how brands, such as DedCool and DS &amp; Durga are shaking up the genre. While all these scents require at least an evening top-up, some, including Nivea , disappear far quicker than others. However, the feeling just one spritz gives me makes it worth the money. Bear that longevity in mind when shopping and layer your scents with the accompanying body lotion or shower gel, if you want to make them stretch.

UK retailer Marks and Spencer (M&amp;S) tells Just Style it is not currently selling any alpaca wool products but it has updated its policy following a ""careful review of updated industry standards"" as PETA calls the move a ""slap in the face"".M&amp;S told Just Style its review had reassured the company that it could reintroduce alpaca wool in the future, knowing that its ""strict animal welfare requirements would be met"".M&amp;S is referring to the Responsible Alpaca Standard (RAS), which the Textile Exchange launched in 2021. The standard aims to verify and identify alpaca fibre produced in farming systems that respect animal welfare and the environment.In 2020, M&amp;S announced it would ""phase out"" use of alpaca wool in future product development following an investigation by animal rights group PETA into the world's largest privately-owned alpaca farm in Peru, Mallkini.The exposé showed workers holding struggling baby alpacas who were shorn with electric clippers, leaving the animals bleeding from deep wounds.Other fashion brands which stopped their use of alpaca wool at the time included Next, New Look, Matalan and Ted Baker, amongst others.PETA's vice president for the UK, Europe and Australia Mimi Bekhechi called M&amp;S' decision ""a slap in the face to compassionate consumers"".""Unless it changes its mind, customers will turn their backs on M&amp;S - just as it has turned its back on animals and sold out to bogus wool industry standard schemes,"" Bekhechi told Just Style.""If M&amp;S wants to stay on the high street and in the good graces of today's conscientious shoppers, it must take the high road and ban alpaca wool - and all animal-derived clothing and accessories - from its stores. And that's exactly what PETA is calling on it to do.""The Textile Exchange told Just Style that it ""recognised the role of animal rights organisations in pushing for change in the fashion industry"" and said its RAS was designed to incentivise the humane treatment of animals.""For the industry to meet its climate and nature goals including the reduction of greenhouse gas emission by 45%, while creating beneficial impacts for animals, people and planet, the industry needs a diverse portfolio of preferred fibres and a reduction in new synthetic materials.""So, while animal rights organisations often hold the position that animal fibres being used for human purposes is unacceptable, we believe that animal-derived materials should only be used if, and when measures can be taken to prevent unnecessary harm to animals.""In 2023, PETA, asked Swedish fashion retailer H&amp;M to produce a report detailing how it sources duck down following claims that inhumane slaughter methods were used by a previous duck down supplier.Copyright © 2024 MarketLine",2024-06-21,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240621:nNRAt1i8a1:1,Marks & Spencer,social
"Jun 21, 2024Investors interested in stocks from the Retail - Supermarkets sector have probably already heard of Marks and Spencer Group PLC (MAKSY) and Jeronimo Martins SGPS SA (JRONY). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let&amp;apos;s take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Currently, Marks and Spencer Group PLC has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Jeronimo Martins SGPS SA has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that MAKSY has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.MAKSY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.78, while JRONY has a forward P/E of 16.26. We also note that MAKSY has a PEG ratio of 0.71. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company&amp;apos;s expected earnings growth rate. JRONY currently has a PEG ratio of 2.55.Another notable valuation metric for MAKSY is its P/B ratio of 2.19. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock&amp;apos;s market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, JRONY has a P/B of 4.55.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to MAKSY&amp;apos;s Value grade of A and JRONY&amp;apos;s Value grade of C.MAKSY has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than JRONY, so it seems like value investors will conclude that MAKSY is the superior option right now.Buy 5 Stocks BEFORE Election DayBiden or Trump?

"Ivy Ong-WoodSienna Miller's free-spirited hippie style proved so popular with Marks &amp; Spencer's customers last autumn that the brand has collaborated with the British actress once again for the summer collection.With a nod to the spirit of summer festivals, classic '70s prints, exotic adventures and some of Miller's favorite vintage finds, the collection embraces the high/low sensibility that reflects Miller's personal style.The fluid lines, rich textures and vintage style fabrications are inspired by iconic looks from Miller's own wardrobe.Taking pride of place is Miller's dress of the season - an ultra-feminine, ruffle maxi dress available in ivory and pale blue.A beaded tank dress reflects her iconic Glastonbury style while a multipurpose sarong references a scarf gifted to her by her father many years ago.The collection also features trusty wardrobe staples such as breezy broderie tops and mesh vests, vintage-inspired printed tops, quilted jackets, classic stripe shirts, as well as a slouchy barrel leg jean with a contrast side panel.Copyright © 2024 GC Media Teamwork Limited",2024-06-20,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240620:nNRAt12k9a:1,Marks & Spencer,social
"I write in response to Oliver Wainwright's piece about our proposed building for Marks &amp; Spencer on London's Oxford Street ( 'Public vandalism': M&amp;S wants to flatten its art deco flagship store – here are six alternative options, 7 June ). As architects, we understand the benefits of retrofit, but at Oxford Street it simply isn't feasible.Our proposal secured support from Westminster council, the London mayor and the independent planning inspector. The highly experienced and wholly independent inquiry inspector dismissed Save Britain's Heritage's retrofit scheme as ""so deeply problematic, even for Oxford Street, that no-one would be likely to pursue it or fund it"".The site contains three buildings of poor quality – unlisted and excluded from the surrounding conservation areas – with misaligned floor levels, cores and column grids, resulting in a confusing environment for customers that is highly problematic for M&amp;S – or any retailer – to operate.The consulting engineer Arup showed that Save's retrofit could be more carbon-intensive than redevelopment. That is before factoring in the superior operational performance of the new building, which would be in the top 1% in the UK. None of the ideas put forward in the Architects' Journal overcome these fundamental issues, and they are not commercially deliverable.As well as modern retail, the project will deliver high-quality office space that is vital for the West End to remain a world-class commercial centre, supporting thousands of jobs, lowering car-reliance and accelerating transition to net zero.Far from an act of vandalism, this long-term investment is an act of placemaking: a positive vision for the nation's high street and a showcase of UK expertise delivering world-class, low-carbon design. It will be a building of which London will be rightly proud.

As British retailer Marks and Spencer (M&amp;S) celebrates the recent 'glow up' of its clothing offering, Just Style investigates how its once tired fashion business is now hitting the mark with consumers.In May 2024 M&amp;S reported a 5.3% increase in clothing and home sales in FY 2023/24, as its share of the UK clothing market increased to 10%, up from 9.6% in the previous year.GlobalData senior retail analyst Eleanor Simpson-Gould said at the time that despite traditionally appealing to an older demographic, M&amp;S had managed to attract a younger audience.The buzz on social media and the positive consumer press the retailer has received in recent months is all testament to this with one influencer telling her followers: ""Honestly, the M&amp;S glow-up is incredible"". So how has M&amp;S managed to make such a dramatic turnaround?1. Tightening the supply chain to respond to trendsM&amp;S' 2024 annual report revealed its ""perception for style"" had increased from 25% in 2022/23 to 29% in 2023/24.Since the pandemic, the retailer has been looking to increase its use of nearshoring supply routes to allow it to respond to emerging trends faster.M&amp;S says it is focusing on consolidating its denim, knitwear and lingerie ranges across fewer suppliers. It also hopes to move away from a slow-moving model with a broad base of suppliers and distribution centres and toward a smaller network.The impact of this change in model was noticeable in how it was able to quickly respond to the resurgent trend of flare and wide-leg jeans. In fact it broadened its range of options in these styles by 50%.In Q4 2023/24 alone, M&amp;S reported selling more than 10,000 pairs of its Palazzo Jeans and in its 2024 annual report, M&amp;S said it sold ten pairs of jeans every minute in the year prior, becoming the top retailer for denim in the UK.Simpson-Gould explains: ""Notably, M&amp;S has concentrated on curating capsule wardrobe essentials, expanding the variety and scope of its products, and enhancing both availability and stock flow. The retailer has reported that this overhaul of its clothing proposition has improved its full price sales share.""2. Full-price focus even during a cost-of-living crisisM&amp;S' ""first price, right price"" strategy seems to be paying off. Despite UK consumers tightening their belts as the cost-of-living crisis continues, in FY 2023/24 the retailer reported full price sales in its clothing and home department had increased from 63% to 81% since 2019/20. M&amp;S's ""perception for value"" increased from 39% in 2022/23 up to 43% in 2023/24, which could explain why consumers are continuing to choose the retailer, despite the ongoing crisis.In line with its commitment on pricing, in June 2024, M&amp;S announced that it would be keep its school uniforms at the same price for the fourth year in a row. The retailer also offers an extended 100-day return period on its school uniform products. Plus, it has invested £1m ($1.27m) in ""school uniform advisors"" in more than 100 stores.Despite becoming more trend-led, M&amp;S has also managed to retain its image as a classic, timeless retailer and it has used its long heritage to its advantage as consumers look for styles that will last them longer as costs continue to rise.GlobalData associate apparel analyst Alice Price tells Just Style: ""The retailer's continued focus on classic styles has enabled it to benefit during the cost-of-living crisis as shoppers seek versatility from their wardrobes.""3. Introducing popular third-party brandsAfter the pandemic saw M&amp;S' clothing sales take a 75% hit, the retailer decided to add third-party brands into its mix.Price notes: ""M&amp;S has shaken off its stale image in recent years, rejuvenating its apparel proposition by introducing fashionable third-party brands and becoming more trend-led, which has enabled it to broaden its customer base.""In 2020, eco-conscious womenswear brand Nobody's Child became M&amp;S' first third-party clothing partner, adding the brand's clothing to its online store. As the partnership developed, the retailer took a 25% stake in the brand in 2021 and featured the range in its stores.Later that year, M&amp;S added Albaray, Celtic &amp; Co, Craghoppers, Fatface, Frugi and Jones the Bootmaker to its roster of third-party brands.More recent additions include Skechers, Crocs and Toms in footwear and as part of its Sports Edit range. M&amp;S has also introduced items from leading sportswear brands such as Adidas, and Sweaty Betty to sit alongside its own popular Goodmove range of activewear.Nishi Mahajan, director of Third-Party Brands at M&amp;S previously told Just Style: ""We know that through our brand platform, we're driving new customers to shop with us, and our existing shoppers are coming back more frequently and spending more - with the majority of brand baskets also containing an M&amp;S product.""4. Seeking out top talentM&amp;S has also made several key hires that seem to have been instrumental in turning around its fashion business. Maddy Sillem, womenswear director at M&amp;S joined the retailer in 2019 after a decade at the UK's high-street favourite Topshop, which went into administration in 2020.Plus, M&amp;S' current head of buying Emma Fox joined the company in 2022 after spending four years at luxury home and clothing retailer The White Company. It should come as no surprise that Fox also came with previous experience at Topshop and online fashion retail giant Asos.What's next for M&amp;S?Simpson-Gould explains online sales for clothing and home products have surpassed instore sales in terms of growth. She says: ""M&amp;S must prioritise an integrated omnichannel approach to ensure that the expansion of its physical store network complements, rather than detracts from its overall sales performance."" When M&amp;S revealed its full-year results for 2023/24 CEO Stuart Machin commented that although the retailer had made progress, its turnaround was far from complete. He said in a statement: ""We need to move faster and be ruthlessly challenging on the areas where progress has been slower, building a more effective digital and technology infrastructure, accelerating the move to a truly personalised customer experience.""Machin added that the retailer has a ""clear plan, a clear vision for the future,"" and sees much more opportunity ahead. He concluded: ""We are at the beginnings of a new M&amp;S.""Copyright © 2024 MarketLine",2024-06-14,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240614:nNRAsz2ulj:1,Marks & Spencer,social

"When Ocado entered the FTSE 100 six years ago, it was seen as a flag-bearer for changing consumer tastes, as traditional retailer Marks &amp; Spencer narrowly avoided relegation from the top tier on the same day.This week, those roles look set to be reversed, with M&amp;S riding high and Ocado now expected to drop out of the index of the UK's top companies in the quarterly reshuffle, after its valuation plunged to about £3bn from a high of £22bn during the pandemic.What's more, its joint venture partner M&amp;S is part of the reason for the weakness in its share price. The pair are wrangling over a final payment for their UK-based grocery delivery tie-up, Ocado Retail, which was hoped to be worth more than £190m. M&amp;S says it should pay nothing because performance has been so poor. Ocado's feisty boss, Tim Steiner, has threatened legal action in response.The final call on Ocado's FTSE position will be made using market data on 4 June, but based on Friday's figures its share price would have to take a last-minute leap to avoid relegation.That seems unlikely amid uncertain sentiment that has led to a drop of about 50% so far this year, to 373p.Ocado is described by Dan Coatsworth at stockbroker AJ Bell as ""one of the most Marmite names on the UK stock market"".When high streets were shut down as way to control Covid, Ocado enjoyed a boost from the shift to home deliveries – and convinced many that the change would be permanent. In the immediate aftermath of the pandemic, it emerged that people had quite missed visiting a shop for their groceries, with the UK's online orders shifting back to about 11% of the market, from a peak of 14% in 2021.Specialists in ultra-fast grocery delivery which enjoyed a private-equity-backed boom during lockdown, such as Getir and Gorillas, have rapidly folded in the UK, leaving the field largely to takeaway meal specialists such as Deliveroo and Just Eat – none of which appear to be making much profit. The trajectory of such groups does not fuel confidence in the future for Ocado's own fast-track service, Zoom, one of its hoped-for growth areas.Ocado made a pre-tax loss of £394m for the year to 3 December 2023; the previous year's loss had been £500m. In April, a fifth of shareholders lodged a protest vote against the group's plans for a £14.8m pay package for Steiner.Meanwhile, Ocado's focus on robot-led warehouse technology has proved to be rather inflexible, such that the company was unable to fully capitalise on booming demand during the pandemic, or row back later without major financial pain.Big supermarkets such as Tesco, Sainsbury's and Waitrose have shut down at least some of their home-delivery warehouses, focusing instead on more cost-effective and flexible deliveries from stores.On the plus side, this year Ocado's retail venture with M&amp;S has stepped up sales growth.However, M&amp;S boss Stuart Machin has recently pointed out that Ocado's much-trumpeted Smart Platform technology upgrades – such as new software and robot picking arms to make deliveries more efficient – had been ""much delayed"", possibly further cooling hopes for the group's efforts to sell its technology around the world.During the pandemic, Ocado's share price also took off as investors saw it as the UK's answer to Silicon Valley technology firms rather than simply an online grocer. It has undoubtedly won some major customers for its gadgetry, including Kroger in the US, Groupe Casino in France, Lotte in South Korea and Aeon in Japan, but investors had hoped for more.Critics, such as Shore Capital's Clive Black, note the millions spent on research and development in return for quite modest sales, while delays to key projects, such as a delivery centre for Coles in Australia, have hit confidence.Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: ""Deals are not being signed as fast as investors were hoping for its future growth engine, Solutions. It charges third-party retailers to use Ocado's robotic systems. There's still big potential here, but timeframes of growth look more questionable and that's knocked thevaluation.""Ocado's expected exit from the FTSE 100 has only fuelled speculation that Ocado will look to list in the US instead of the UK. Steiner may encounter fewer complaints about multimillion-pound pay deals across the Atlantic but whether that will help find new fans of the group's robots remains in doubt.Copyright (c) 2024 observer.theguardian.com-NonSyndicated",2024-06-02,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240602:nNRAsulncb:1,Marks & Spencer,social

Marks &amp; Spencer has reported it will offer a dedicated clothing repair service for the first time.With new insight from M&amp;S revealing only 10% of the population is confident enough to repair clothing themselves and 60% of consumers looking for retailers to offer more services which support them to lower their carbon footprint, M&amp;S is partnering with clothing repair and alterations experts, SOJO. Founded in 2021 by Josephine Philips, SOJO is on a mission to make tailoring and repairs more accessible. Today, the small but growing team is made up of tailors, riders, developers and creatives working to accelerate change in the fashion industry. With a shared set of values, the two businesses have come together, as partners in change. According to WRAP, the climate action NGO, in the UK alone, 1.6 billion items of clothing in our wardrobes aren't being worn - which is an average of 31 items per person. The 'M&amp;S fixed by SOJO' hub - launching in August - will support M&amp;S customers to give their M&amp;S clothes 'Another life.' and reduce textile waste, a key pillar of the retailer's Plan A roadmap to drive the circular economy. The partnership builds on the retailers established clothes donation scheme with Oxfam, which has collected over 36 million items of clothing raising an estimated £23m to tackle poverty around the world. Giving clothes Another life. Through a dedicated online hub, M&amp;S customers will be able to select and book a range of bespoke repair services - from zip replacements to invisible knitwear mending - all through one simple online form. With repairs starting from just £5, M&amp;S clothing can be sent, repaired by SOJOs in-house repair team and returned directly to the customers doorstep within seven to 10 days.  The partnership with SOJO comes as M&amp;S reveals 'Another life.' Visible across the retailer's, website, app and stores from this month, Plan A - 'Another life.' brings together all the retailer's circularity services into one place. From the new partnership with SOJO, Beauty Takeback Scheme with Handle to its long-running clothes donation partnership with Oxfam, which was formerly known as 'Shwopping', all initiatives now sit together as part of Plan A - 'Another Life.' to offer a more seamless experience for customers who are looking for ways they can support a shift to a more circular economy. As well as a range of services, the Plan A - 'Another life.' platform will be home to a selection of 60 second 'how to' videos covering everything from debobbling knitwear to adjusting hemlines - created by M&amp;S' team of in-house technical experts.  Plan A, because there is no Plan B Last week, M&amp;S published its annual ESG Report 2024** revealing the progress made to date on its Plan A roadmap. Looking ahead, the retailer is continuing to find new ways to reduce textile waste to drive the circular economy.  The new partnership with SOJO is supported by M&amp;S' Plan A Accelerator Fund which aims to take rapid action to climate change through a series of innovation projects. Earlier this year, the fund was used to support an online postal trial with Oxfam which enabled customers to donate their unwearable - but too good to waste - clothing, alongside their pre-loved wearable clothing directly to Oxfam to be resold, reused, or recycled.  Richard Price, Managing Director of Clothing &amp; Home at M&amp;S, commented: ""At M&amp;S, exceptional quality products are at the heart of everything we do, and we want to ensure that all our clothes are too good to waste. Through the launch of our repair service, we're making it even easier for customers to give their clothes Another life, whether they are using our new repair service or long-standing clothes recycling scheme.""  Josephine Phillips, Founder and CEO of SOJO, commented: ""It has always been a core mission of ours at SOJO to make repairing clothes mainstream and to extend the life of as many garments as possible.

Description: More than 6,500 Samsung electronics workers began a three-day strike on Monday, after the world's biggest memory chip maker revealed a surge in Q2 operating profit.

Video Transcript:
Samsung workers hit the picket lines once again. Welcome to Asia Markets Briefing. I'm Thomas Warner. More than 6,500 Samsung Electronics workers began a three-day strike today. Theyâre after improved performance-based bonuses and increased holiday allowances following a surge in second quarter profits, the world's biggest memory chipmaker. Only around a quarter of Samsung's union members walked out on Monday, limiting the impact on operations. The union bosses say that today's action is just the beginning. Meanwhile, workers in Japan saw their average base pay climb by 2.5% in May. That's the fastest pace in 31 years. The gains were particularly strong for part-time workers, but when adjusted for inflation, real wages actually fell for a record 26th straight month. SMBC's chief market economist leaves at real wages could start rising as soon as July. The Bank of Japan believes that its labor shortages that are causing smaller firms to hike wages. The verdict came from a summary of discussions at the BOJ's meeting of regional branch managers. It could strengthen the case for the bank to raise rates at the end of this month. Turning to the markets now and Asia's main indices all traded lower on Monday. The wider index of Asian shares were weighed down by a tough day for the Shanghai Composite. But it was Hong Kong that suffered the heaviest losses, falling in every single sector. EV maker BYD was among the major casualties. The Nikkei and India's Nifty 50 also ticked lower. The major oil benchmarks traded lower on hopes of a ceasefire in Gaza, meanwhile. A deal could ease regional tension and reduce the chance of disruption to supply. Some temporary disruption to supply is likely in the US Gulf Coast, where Hurricane Beryl is set to make landfall on Monday. All of Texas's major ports have closed as a precaution. Any damage to the regionâs refineries would have a lasting impact on margins. China's Association of Automobile Manufacturers says that it's âstrongly dissatisfiedâ with anti-subsidy tariffs that have been proposed by the European Union. Levies of up to 37.6% on Chinese electric vehicle imports were imposed last Friday. The tariffs are provisional while the EU investigates whether the cars are being built with state subsidies. But the manufacturers group accused EU investigators of pre-selecting results and ignoring facts. European and Chinese authorities will hold intensive talks over the next four months. Britain's Ocado has boosted its partnership with Japan's Aeon. They plan to build a third robotic warehouse together. Online supermarket and technology group Ocado entered an exclusive partnership with Aeon back in 2019. The warehouse in Kuki-Miyashiro, just north of Tokyo, should go live in 2027. Coming up on Tuesday, Taiwan publishes its June trade data. Economists polled by Reuters expect imports and exports to have rebounded in June after disappointing annual growth in May. They believe that imports will rise by 15% and exports to rise by 11.45%. And that's it from your Asia Markets Briefing.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

"Fitch Ratings-London-29 July 2024:
Fitch Ratings has assigned Ocado Group PLC's (Ocado) prospective GBP350 million 2029 notes an expected senior unsecured instrument rating of 'B-(EXP)' with a Recovery Rating of 'RR4'. This is aligned with Ocado's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'B-', which has a Stable Outlook, and existing unsecured instrument rating.Ocado plc is planning to raise GBP250 million convertibles notes and GBP350 million unsecured notes. The proceeds of the new notes will be used towards part prepayment of its existing debt, in particular via tender offers for part of the GBP600 million convertible loan due in December 2025 and the GBP500 million unsecured notes due in October 2026. We assume that any cash remaining unused in the tender offers will remain earmarked for debt repayment subsequently. The new notes will rank equally and share guarantors with Ocado's existing unsecured notes and convertible bonds. The assignment of the final rating is conditional on completion and final terms and conditions being in line with information received.We view positively Ocado's proactive attempt to address its refinancing risk, which would otherwise weigh negatively on the rating 12-15 months ahead of the debt maturity. Ocado plans to also extend its GBP300 million undrawn revolving credit facility (RCF), maturing in June 2025, as part of the refinancing exercise.Ocado's rating reflects its technological capabilities to help drive online grocery profitability as well as high execution risk to reach scale and profitability. Based on our estimates, if all debt is refinanced, Ocado may maintain sufficient cash to fund its capex in FY24-FY26 (year-end November). Material debt repayment from cash would however reduce available liquidity to fund capex, which would be negative for the rating.
Key Rating Drivers
ProactivelyAddressing Refinancing Risk: We view positively Ocado's proactive attempt to address upcoming debt maturities via today's planned debt issue. We assume voluntary open market repurchases of its existing debt with no coercion, in which case debt buybacks with slight discount would not be deemed distressed debt exchange. The debt will be refinanced at materially higher interest rates than paid currently (0.875% coupon for the convertible). Inability to refinance or refinancing at materially higher rates than assumed would be negative for the rating.Improving, PositiveFY24EBITDA: We forecast EBITDA (post rents) of around GBP60 million in FY24 before it rises to GBP185 million by FY26. This compares with GBP14 million in FY23 after a period of losses for the last nine years. However, following the group's update in mid-July, our forecast now excludes one new CFC due to its customer, Canadian food retailer Sobey's, pausing after mutual agreement&amp;nbsp; their new opening and reflects improved profitability from customer Kroger, US food retailer, rolling out new technology in combination with additional capex to retrofit its CFC network.High Execution Risk: We see high execution risk in Ocado's business plan to ramp up existing CFCs, roll out new CFCs and deliver efficiencies to drive earnings growth. Profit growth plans rest on the addition of eight new international CFCs over the next three years and on reaching full CFC capacity by the fifth or six year of going live. Customers' CFCs have demonstrated slower-than-anticipated ramp-up, due to weaker online grocery demand and, in some cases, operational challenges. Ocado is helping its clients via its ""partner success"" programme but the results of these efforts are not fully in Ocado's control.Satisfactory Liquidity: Ocado had sufficient cash balances of around GBP800 million at FYE23 to fund FY24 and FY25 capex, but cash will be eroded by FYE28. Material debt reduction with cash would further reduce available liquidity and could be negative for the rating. Cash will be supported by nearly GBP160&amp;nbsp;million cash inflows to be received from its Autostore settlement over FY24-FY25. We also assume that its GBP300 million RCF, currently undrawn, remains fully available and will be extended to support liquidity as part of refinancing exercise.Scale and Cost Control: We believe the business should generate adequate profit margins once it reaches scale, with EBITDA margins improving to 16.5% by FY27. Our forecast incorporates lower direct operating costs, including technology and support costs. Ocado has stated it targets to reduce annual cash technology costs to GBP240 million (from GBP292 million in FY23) and its cash support costs to GBP150 million (GBP191 million in FY23) in the medium term.Negative FCF: We project an average of GBP300 million annual negative free cash flow (FCF) over FY24-FY26. Ocado has stated that it expects to turn FCF-positive in 2HFY26. We believe that Ocado has further scope to lower its technology and support costs. We also understand from management that the group does not intend to raise more debt beyond its refinancing needs and plans to fund growth capex from internally generated cash in the medium term.Further Refinancing Needed: Our rating case projects that despite the transaction, Ocado will need to refinance the majority of its unsecured notes in 2026 and a second GBP350 million convertible Note due in January 2027 as well as raise some new funding. We also see a risk that FCF may remain negative in FY27, after it has deployed its current cash balances.Key InternationalCustomers: Kroger is a key customer with eight live CFCs that have been slower to ramp up against the original plan of 20 CFCs, which Ocado is assisting via its ""partner success"" programme. Recently Kroger has demonstrated confidence in Ocado's solution by ordering Ocado's latest technology to retrofit its existing CFCs. Sobey's has three live CFCs, while the fourth one has been paused. Opening of two new CFCs for Australian food retailer Coles is expected shortly, after a delay from FY23. Alcampo will also launch its Madrid CFC this week.Overall, at FYE23, Ocado's technology was employed at 14 international CFCs by five customers, with an average of 3.14 modules in each CFC, which have gradually gone live since FY20.Incremental OIA: Ocado plans to grow its intelligent automation (OIA) segment in a capital-light way, having one contracted partner, US healthcare distributor McKesson Corporation, to go live in FY25. We incorporate only limited profit and cash contribution, but understand from management that Ocado has a strong OIA pipeline and growth ambitions for this segment.Low Margin forJVORL: Ocado Retail Limited (ORL), which we deconsolidate in our projections, reported only a small profit in FY23, which was in line with its guidance. This was due to higher fees and support costs, despite growth in sales, stable gross profit margin and efficiencies in fulfilment and delivery costs. In 1HFY24, ORL reported continued positive momentum in active customer numbers, average orders per week and in basket value driving growth in revenues and EBITDA. Nevertheless, ORL guides to a fairly low 2.5% adjusted EBITDA margin (before GBP33 million payment for unused capacity at Hatfield CFC to Ocado solutions) for FY24.Importance of Profitable Online Channel: Ocado's technology enables efficiency and profitability in the online channel, which is critical to retailers. We expect retail sales in the online channel to expand in the long term. In turn, this should continue driving demand for Ocado's solutions.
Derivation Summary
Fitch applies its Business Service Navigator framework to Ocado. This reflects that the UK retail operations under 50%-owned ORL are ringfenced with no direct recourse from Ocado's lenders and our view that the business risk profile of the solutions business will drive Ocado's credit quality in the long term, due to its the accelerating growth and investments.In comparison with Irel Bidco S.a.r.l (IFCO, B+/Stable), which provides reusable packaging container solutions to the retail sector, Ocado is less established and has higher execution risk. IFCO is a global leader in a niche market and benefits from scale, geographic diversification, as well as longstanding customer relationships in a sector with good growth prospects. Ocado will have similar characteristics once its business reaches its targeted scale, in addition to a contracted revenue base, low customer churn and high switching costs (a function of its bespoke technology). This helps counterbalance some reliance on Kroger as its key customer and partner.Once it reaches scale, Ocado should demonstrate solid profitability for the rating, with an EBITDA margin trending towards 16%, which is below the more established IFCO's above 20%. Given their current excessive level, leverage metrics are not a rating driver for Ocado but our expectation of a progressive reduction to around 7x-8x by FY26 supports the rating. This level compares with lower expected leverage for IFCO at below 6.0x, which is better aligned with the 'B' rating category.We have also compared Ocado with Polygon Group AB (B/Negative), a market leader on the European property damage restoration industry. Both companies have comparable business profiles with leading market positions in their respective industries and similar scale. Ocado has better geographical diversification and expected revenue visibility than Polygon, which is exposed to the German market with shorter-length contracts. This is offset by the higher execution risk of Ocado's business.Polygon had higher EBITDA margin of around 6.0% in 2022 but we expect that Ocado's profitability will improve to 11.0% in FY25 as it continues to ramp up existing CFCs and drive efficiencies. Polygon had lower EBITDA leverage at around 9.0x in 2022 than Ocado due to lower operating profitability, but is expected to recover to around 7.0x.
Key Assumptions
Fitch's Key Assumptions Within Our Rating Case for the Issuer:- Revenue for the technology solutions segment to grow to GBP630 million in FY26 as CFCs are ramped up and rolled out (eight new CFCs and 46 new modules added in FY24-FY26- Revenues for UK logistics increasing towards GBP720 million by FY26- EBITDAR for the technology solutions segment to rise to near GBP65 million in FY24 and GBP185&amp;nbsp;million in FY26- EBITDAR for the UK logistics segment to gradually grow to around GBP35 million in FY27 from around GBP30&amp;nbsp;million in FY24- Lease cost on average GBP30 million per year in FY24-FY26- Gross capex (excluding ORL) averaging GBP430 million a year in FY24-FY27- Cash inflows of GBP100 million and GBP58 million in FY24 and FY25, respectively, from Autostore settlement- No dividends from ORL- No M&amp;amp;A, no common dividend payments
Recovery Analysis
Fitch's Key Recovery Rating Assumptions:The recovery analysis assumes that Ocado would be reorganised as a going concern (GC) in bankruptcy rather than liquidated. Fitch has assumed a 10% administrative claim and the value available to creditors consisting of the sum of Ocado restricted group's enterprise value (EV) and 50% of ORL.Ocado's GC EBITDA is based on FY25 EBITDA for the restricted group at around GBP105 million (previously on FY24 expected EBITDA of around GBP80 million) capturing CFCs that are under construction now and to open shortly. Fitch expects GBP95 million (GBP71 million previously) of this would be available to creditors post-restructuring, due to execution risks in the international technology segment while also recognising a more established UK business.We have used an unchanged 6.0x EV/EBITDA multiple, which is in line with business services companies' distressed multiple, but reflects the strong growth of Ocado's business and its market positionAdditionally, we attribute half of our estimated GBP0.6 billion (GBP0.9 billion previously) GC valuation of ORL business to Ocado's cashflow waterfall. We view that a default of ORL would not be simultaneous and consequently base the JV valuation on an expected sustainable medium-term EBITDA of GBP75 million (revised from GBP110 million) and an 8x multiple, which is not a distressed valuation. The multiple is based on trading multiples for grocers and higher multiples for pure online retailers and technology companies. Any additional debt at the JV above the assumed GBP30 million RCF will affect the value attributed to it.Ocado's GBP300 million secured RCF ranks ahead of its other existing debt. Senior unsecured notes (GBP500 million) rank equally with its GBP950 million convertibles.The outcome of the recovery analysis for senior unsecured notes is 'B-'/'RR4', aligned with Ocado's Long-Term IDR. The waterfall analysis output percentage is 32% (unchanged). Should additional debt ranking ahead or equally with unsecured notes be added to Ocado's capital structure, this will push the Recovery Rating of the notes to 'RR5'.We expect the outcome of the recovery analysis, once the new senior unsecured notes are issued, to be 'B-'/'RR4', which is aligned with Ocado's existing senior secured instrument rating. This is based on the assumption that, in the event that not all the GBP600m proceeds from the current transaction are utilized in the planned tender offers, unused proceeds will remain earmarked for subsequent debt repayment of the current GBP1,450m senior unsecured debt.
RATING SENSITIVITIES
FactorsThat Could, IndividuallyorCollectively, LeadtoPositive Rating Action/Upgrade:-Fitch does not envisage a positive rating action during FY24-FY28, due to execution risks associated with the transformation into a solutions and business service provider. However, over the long term, evidence of greater maturity of the business, with increasing scale and diversification and lower upfront capex would indicate successful execution of Ocado's growth strategy would be positive for the rating, together with:- EBITDA trending to GBP200 million- Sufficient positive FCF generation to fund growth capex- EBITDA interest coverage recovering towards 1.5x- Visibility of EBITDA gross leverage trending below 6.5x on a sustained basisFactorsThat Could, IndividuallyorCollectively, LeadtoNegative Rating Action/Downgrade:- Inability to refinance 12-15 months ahead of debt maturities or insufficient liquidity to fund at least two years of capex- Continued execution challenges, such as further delays in roll-out of new CFCs, inability to scale up existing CFCs, or deliver technology or support cost efficiencies leading to EBITDA not reaching at least GBP50 million in FY24 and at least GBP100 million by FY25, and a faster cash burn than captured in our rating case- Readily available cash materially below GBP500 million at FYE24
Liquidity and Debt Structure
Adequate Cash to Fund Investments: The restricted group (ie excluding ORL) has an adequate, but declining, cash position comprising around GBP800 million cash and a fully undrawn GBP300 million RCF. We expect this liquidity to support its FY24-FY26 high capex. We estimate available liquidity of GBP850&amp;nbsp;million at FYE24.Approaching Debt Maturities: Ocado's medium-term liquidity profile is strongly dependent on its ability to timely address upcoming GBP600 million convertible notes due December 2025 and GBP500 million senior unsecured notes due October 2026 with external resources. The RCF expires in June 2025 but has an option to extend by one year that we expect to be exercised.Ocado has demonstrated strong access to financial markets via capital raises, including GBP500 million senior unsecured notes in September 2021, following a GBP350 million convertible bond (due in January 2027) along with a GBP657 million new share placement in 2020.
Issuer Profile
Ocado is a technology company that develops end-to-end operating solutions for online grocery retail. It also has its own grocery retail operations, which are ringfenced in a JV with M&amp;amp;S.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT AN OFFER OF SECURITIES IN ANY JURISDICTION.    THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION.    For immediate release   29 July 2024   Ocado Group plc    Proposed Convertible Bond Offering   Ocado Group plc (""Ocado"" or the ""Company"") is today launching an offering of approximately £250 million of guaranteed senior unsecured convertible bonds due 2029 (the ""Bonds"") (the ""Convertible Bond Offering"").  Concurrently with the Convertible Bond Offering the Company has today also announced its intention to offer £350 million in aggregate principal amount of sterling-denominated senior unsecured notes due 2029 (the ""High Yield Offering"", and together with the Convertible Bond Offering, the ""Offerings"").The Offerings are intended to raise total gross proceeds of approximately £600 million.  The Convertible Bond Offering will be offered via an accelerated bookbuild which will be launched immediately following this Announcement only to institutional investors. Barclays Bank PLC, BNP PARIBAS and Goldman Sachs International are acting as Joint Global Coordinators (the ""Joint Global Coordinators"") and the Joint Global Coordinators together with Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch are acting as Joint Bookrunners (together, the ""Joint Bookrunners"") in respect of the Convertible Bond Offering.   The final terms of the Convertible Bond Offering are expected to be announced at the end of the accelerated bookbuild.  The Company has today also announced an invitation to the holders ofOcado's outstanding 0.875% senior unsecured convertible bonds due 2025 and 3.875% senior unsecured notes due 2026 (together, the ""Target Securities"") to tender such Target Securities (the ""Tender Offer""). The Tender Offer was extended to holders of the Target Securities who are non-US persons and located outside the United States.  Use of Proceeds   The net proceeds from the Offerings, together with cash from the balance sheet to the extent needed, are intended to be used to fund the Tender Offer.  To the extent the net proceeds of the Offerings exceed the amount required to purchase the Target Securities pursuant to the Tender Offer, Ocado expects to retain such funds to be used to reduce leverage over time, whether at maturity of the relevant debt or otherwise.  The purpose of these financing transactions is, amongst other things, to proactivelyextend the maturity profile of Ocado's debt. An appropriate financing policy and sufficient liquidity position continue to be an important foundation to enable investment in Ocado's growth plans while maintaining a healthy financial profile.  Current trading within Ocado evidencing positive momentum    On 16 July 2024 Ocado reported strong H1 earnings demonstrating continuing financial, operational and strategic progress. The Company reported revenue growth of £1.5 billion, up +12.6%, with good profit flow through, resulting in a raise of FY24 margin guidance to mid-teens percentage, as well as an improvement to underlying cash flow. As evidenced by the recent reported growth of online for grocers, it is clear that the global channel shift to grocery online has now resumed and Ocado is uniquely well-positioned to take advantage of this opportunity.  Most recently, Ocado announced a new order from Kroger to install its latest proprietary automation across multiple Customer Fulfilment Centres in the United States. Ocado remains resolutely focused on making continued progress over the rest of the financial year and beyond, as the business continues to grow into a profitable, cash-generating, technology business.  Details of the Convertible Bond Offering   The Bonds will be issued by Ocado and initially guaranteed by Ocado Holdings Limited, Ocado Operating Limited, Ocado Central Services Limited, Ocado Innovation Limited, Ocado Solutions Limited, Ocado Solutions USA Inc., Ocado Solutions (US) ProCo LLC, Ocado Solutions Canada Inc., and Ocado Intelligent Automation Limited (together, the ""Guarantors""), with the Guarantors subject to change in certain circumstances.  The Bonds will be issued at par and are expected to carry a coupon of between5.75% and6.25% per annum payable semi-annually in arrears in equal instalments on6February and6August of each year, commencing on6 February 2025. The Bonds will be convertible into ordinary shares in the capital of the Company (""Ordinary Shares""). The initial conversion price is expected to be set at a premium of between45% and50% above the clearing price of an existing Ordinary Share determined in the concurrent Delta Placement (as defined below). The conversion price will be subject to adjustment in certain circumstances in line with market practice.  To facilitate hedging for certain subscribers of the Bonds,the Joint Global Coordinatorswill, on behalf of certain subscribers of the Bonds, organise a simultaneous placement of existing Ordinary Shares (the ""Delta Placement"")to purchasers procured by the Joint Global Coordinators.  The Ordinary Shares to be sold in the Delta Placement will be part of the accelerated bookbuilding process, but the Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of these Ordinary Shares as these are not being issued by, or sold on behalf of, the Company.  The Company has no responsibility or liability for stamp duty or any other transfer tax which may arise from or be due on the sale of these Ordinary Shares.  Settlement and delivery of the Bonds is expected to take place on or about6August 2024(the ""Closing Date""). If not previously converted, redeemed or purchased and cancelled, the Bonds will be redeemed at par on6August 2029. The Company will have the option to redeem all outstanding Bonds on or after27August 2027, at par plus accrued interest, if the parity value on each of at least 20 dealing days in a period of 30 consecutive dealing days shall have exceeded130%of the principal amount.  The Company will also have the option to redeem all outstanding Bonds, at par plus accrued interest, at any time if85%or more of the principal amount of the Bonds originally issued shall have been previously redeemed, converted or repurchased and cancelled.

Kroger will implement Ocado's advanced automated technologies across its customer fulfilment centres (CFCs). The new technologies include Ocado's On-Grid Robotic Pick (OGRP) - a robotic arm that is installed directly on the grid - and its Automated Frameload (AFL). They are designed to lower the cost of serving from CFCs and improve Kroger's market-leading customer proposition. These enhancements are part of a broader trend, with global partners such as AEON in Japan also adopting Ocado's latest solutions to upgrade their distribution networks. Ocado's technology is already in use within UK CFCs, where it is successfully picking a wide range of items. When operating at full capacity, the OGRP technology can pick up 70% of an extensive online grocery range, demonstrating its potential impact on Kroger's operations. The move enhances efficiency and labour productivity within Kroger's delivery network. Ocado Group CEO Tim Steiner said: ""We are delivering a step-change in warehouse automation and new levels of efficiency to our partners as global supply chains are under significant pressure to manage higher volumes and greater complexity, as well as challenges in labour cost and availability.

Advanced machine vision, deep reinforcement learning, and sensing capabilities enable OGRP to pick tens of thousands of products and pack them densely into bags with precision and accuracy.   About Automated Frameload   Automated Frameload (AFL) automates the most physically demanding job in the warehouse - the loading of prepared customer orders onto delivery frames ready for dispatch. AFL enables the efficient and accurate loading of delivery totes without human touch.  Computer vision examines the tote and the frame, forms an understanding of the dimensions and shape of the tote and enables alignment with the frame, making direction adjustments in real time to push the tote in.  About Ocado Group   Ocado Group is a UK based technology company trading on the London Stock Exchange (Ticker OCDO). It provides end-to-end online grocery fulfilment solutions to thirteen of the world's largest grocery retailers and holds a 50% share of Ocado Retail Ltd in the UK in a Joint Venture with Marks &amp; Spencer.

Ocado is a year and a half into a strategic realignment that focuses on three core pillars of unbeatable choice, unrivalled service and value.Online grocery retailer Ocado Retail has released its figures for the 26 weeks ending 2 June 2024, marking impressive growth despite food inflation easing in the UK market.The retailer recorded an 11.3% increase in revenue during the period and achieved a positive adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) of £20.7m, driving its share price up by 17%.Leading data and analytics company GlobalData forecast 3.6% growth in the UK food and grocery online market for the first half of 2024 (H1 2024), which Ocado has exceeded, suggesting that the grocer has gained market share.GlobalData senior retail analyst Eleanor Simpson-Gould explained that for Ocado ""this first half of strong double-digit growth will be a welcome relief in pressure to strengthen its relationship with partner Marks &amp; Spencer and revitalise its struggling image.""In H1 2024, Ocado has made progress on its Perfect Execution Plan which includes a price promise extended to 2,800 products.Simpson-Gould states that ""this strategy is yielding results, as active customer numbers surpassed one million this half, marking an increase of 8.1% versus 2023. Significantly, Ocado's 'mature' customers - those who have shopped more than five times with the retailer - have risen 9.7% year-on-year.""These figures indicate that Ocado is not only attracting new customers but also fostering loyalty and encouraging repeat business from its existing clientele, a crucial metric after a year in which transient consumers shifted to discounters.""Despite improved revenue and customer acquisition, Ocado's average basket value has not achieved the same robust growth as its other key performance indicators, increasing by a modest £2.14 to £123.36 compared to 2023's figure of £121.22.Though Ocado's selling price increased 1.5%, Simpson-Gould suggests that Ocado customers are cautious in their spending and that more work needs to be done to convert shoppers into higher price points.""Ocado must strike a balance of improving value perception without diluting its premium range and focus on driving volume growth. The launch of new products and targeted promotional discounts will be crucial.""The retailer has cautioned investors that it anticipates subdued revenue growth in FY24, influenced by a deceleration in average selling price growth as food price inflation stabilises.In April 2024, Ocado experienced difficulties after a proposed bonus plan for co-founder and chief executive Tim Steiner sparked investor discontent at the company's annual general meeting.Copyright © 2024 MarketLine",2024-07-17,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240717:nNRAta3uh1:1,Ocado,social

Description: European shares fell on Tuesday following weakness in metal miners and dour earnings from luxury retailer Hugo Boss. On Wednesday, the market focus shifts to the last official CPI reading before the next Bank of England policy meeting. Also coming up are ASML earnings, with the chip equipment maker seen benefitting from an influx of recent AI-related orders.

Video Transcript:
Europe's markets sag; UK inflation and ASML earnings head up Wednesday's diary. Welcome to Europe Markets Briefing. I'm David Pollard. European shares fell today on weakness in metal miners and dour earnings from Hugo Boss. London's FTSE 100 hit a one-week low, with investors cautious ahead of UK inflation data. The personal goods sector was the biggest laggard on a raft of downbeat headlines from Burberry and other luxury names. In that frame, Hugo Boss tanked over 8% after the fashion house cut its forecast on slowing demand, especially in China and the UK. But Ocado soared 18% to the top of the FTSE 250, after the online grocery group reported a smaller first-half loss and raised its guidance for the full year. Germany's much-watched ZEW Investor Sentiment Index worsened by more than expected this month, coming in at 41.8 from 47.5 prior. The ZEW lists falling export, political uncertainty in France, and a lack of clarity over ECB policy as factors. Manufacturing is also struggling with industrial orders unexpectedly falling in May. The CEBR's Vicky Pryce says Germany needs a lift from anywhere.
The German economy is still looking pretty shaky. It needs to have a boost from somewhere. And the real question is from where? And for the moment, if investor confidence remains as weak as it is, then I can't see where it's going to come from unless the consumer wakes up and starts spending a lot more.
The focus shifts to the UK on Wednesday. King Charles will announce the agenda of the New Labour government to Parliament. And ahead of the Bank of England's policy meeting in two weeks, UK data is expected to show inflation stuck at 2% in June. Policymakers are watching services prices closely. They've been rising nearly 6% in annual terms. Jobs data on Thursday will also be key, amid worries over wages growth. Top billing for European earnings goes to ASML tomorrow. The chip equipment supplier is seen with an influx of new orders as customers meet booming demand for AI chips. Its shares are up 45% this year, trading near record highs. Analysts expect Q2 net income of EUR1.41 billion on revenues of EUR6.04 billion. Finally, oil prices have slipped more than 1%, largely on worries of a slowing Chinese economy, though China did get a significant upgrade in today's update to the IMF World Economic Outlook, with a small boost for the Eurozone too. The fund now sees China growing 5% this year from 4.6% forecast in April. The Eurozone is up by a 0.1% to 0.9%, while the US forecast was cut by 0.1% to 2.6%.

"Shares in Ocado jumped by as much as 18% after the UK online grocer reported narrowing losses and raised its annual guidance for its technology arm, which sells warehouse robots to other retailers around the world.Technology revenues climbed by nearly 22% year on year in the six months to 2 June, while retail revenues were also up by 11%. Ocado sells groceries in the UK through its joint venture with Marks &amp; Spencer and was the fastest-growing grocer for the fifth month in a row based on recent sales figures, according to the data analytics company Kantar.Ocado now expects its tech division to achieve a ""mid-teens"" Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margin this year, up from previous guidance of more than 10%. The company's overall pre-tax loss in the first half of the year narrowed to £154m, from £290m a year earlier.This reassured investors, and drove Ocado shares sharply higher. The stock closed up 8% at 368.1p but hit 409.1p earlier in the day.The share price has lost 47% this year amid concerns that some clients, such as the Canadian supermarket Sobeys and Kroger in the US, are pausing the rollout of robotic warehouses.Tim Steiner, Ocado's chief executive, explained that clients had based their plans on trends seen during the Covid pandemic when online shopping surged – but then fell back as shops reopened. He said the global shift to online shopping had resumed and brushed off investor concerns, saying: ""We expect to see a lot of long-term growth.""With grocery inflation slowing sharply from last year's double-digit increases, consumer sentiment has been rising. Steiner said: ""It's definitely improved. Consumers are in a better position than they were this time about a year ago, when it felt like everything was constantly moving up at crazy levels, other than people's incomes.""He noted that grocery inflation is now running at 1.6%, according to Kantar, below average wage rises. But he added: ""Obviously consumers are still feeling the pinch.""Commenting on whether Ocado would keep its stock market listing in the UK, he said: ""The London market can be tough for some companies. Obviously, we've got a very strong retail presence here in the UK with Ocado Retail, it's a natural place for that business to be listed.""In the long-term future as a global tech company, could you consider other markets? You could but we're actually really focused at the moment on serving our clients well … And those efforts are really where we're focusing our time and not on where we're listed.""Steiner reckons that there is still demand for Ocado's fast-delivery service Zoom, despite the demise of rivals such as Getir and Gorillas. He said: ""I do think that there is demand for ultra-fast services.""Copyright (c) 2024 theguardian.com-NonSyndicated",2024-07-16,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240716:nNRAt9kfvr:27,Ocado,social

Video Transcript:
Ocado shares jumped as much as 15% on Tuesday. Investors were cheered after the food delivery firm lifted guidance for its key warehouse technology division. Ocado runs an online supermarket in the UK through a joint venture with Marks &amp; Spencer. It also sells cutting-edge warehouse technology to retailers around the world. Before Tuesday's update, shares had slumped by more than half this year. The market was concerned by a slowdown in the rollout of robotic sites and modules for its retail partners. CEO Tim Steiner said Ocado was talking to potential new partners and had a strong pipeline of interest. He added Ocado did not need to raise additional capital, pointing to liquidity of more than $1.30 billion. Ocado said it now expects its technology solutions division to achieve a mid-teens earnings margin before tax in the 2023-2024 year, up from previous guidance of 10%.

European bourses are weighed by miners and luxury sector woes. Welcome to Europe Today. I'm David Pollard. European shares opened lower today, hit by dour earnings from Hugo Boss and Richemont, and pressured by weakness in metals miners as they tracked easing copper prices. Adding to their losses, Rio Tinto fell over 2% after reporting second quarter iron ore shipments below estimates. Those luxury results add to a picture of pain for the sector, especially in China. Richemont sales were almost flat in the three months through June with a slump in Chinese demand for the Cartier-owner pushing the overall results slightly below expectations. And after a host of other warnings and weakened numbers from across the sector this week, Hugo Boss shares tanked nearly 9% in early trade. That's after it cut its sales forecast on slower demand in markets including China and the UK. Prada, meanwhile, hit its lowest since mid-February, down around 6%. Also in today's movers, British water firms United Utilities and Severn Trent were among the top losers on the FTSE 100. Both down after regulators opened enforcement cases against them and two others in a probe into wastewater management. But Ocado soared 18% to the top of the FTSE 250 after reporting a smaller first-half loss. Its shares had lost more than half their value this year, but the online grocery group is now talking of better margins for its warehouse technology and lifting its annual guidance. And there was some good news for UK grocery customers today. Kantar industry data showing that grocery inflation has at 1.6% slowed to its lowest level since 2021. That coincides with the fastest rise in monthly supermarket shopper numbers so far this year it said. In other news today, Germany's ZEW Economic Sentiment index has fallen this month to 41.8 from 47.5 prior. The new reading is below a Reuters poll of 42.3 for sentiment and shows economic expectations are falling for the first time in a year. Euro zone bond yields were easing for a second day ahead of that data and the spread between US and European government yields saw its largest daily rise in weeks on Monday, on concerns over a possible deterioration in US government finances should Donald Trump lead the next administration. Meanwhile, the ECB's policy meeting this week is coming into view. No change is expected there, though, in the US on Monday, comments from Jerome Powell reinforced hopes of a September rate cut from the Fed.
We wanted to have greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably down toward our 2% target and what increases that confidence in that is more good inflation data. And lately here we have been getting some of that.
And that is Europe Today.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024. Click For Restrictions - http://about.reuters.com/fulllegal.asp",2024-07-16,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240716:nRTVbpjJ2P:17,Ocado,social
"Online grocer Ocado has revealed interim losses nearly halved and said annual earnings for its robotic warehouse arm would be better than expected despite delays with some key contracts.The group reported a £154 million pre-tax loss for the six months to June 2 against losses of £290 million a year ago.It notched up revenues of £1.54 billion for the first half, boosted by a 21.8% surge in its technology solutions business, which powers online grocery businesses and automated warehouses for other retailers.Ocado retail – run as a joint venture with Marks &amp; Spencer – saw revenues rise 11.3%, helping the division swing to underlying earnings of £20.7 million from a £2.5 million loss a year earlier.The global channel shift to online has now resumed and Ocado is uniquely well-positioned to take advantage of the opportunityTim Steiner, Ocado chief executiveOcado said it was on track for annual underlying earnings margins in its technology solutions business to be in the ""mid-teens"", having previously guided for at least 10%, helping shares bounce back by 11% in morning trading on Tuesday after heavy losses on Monday.This comes in spite of some major customers – such as US grocer Kroger Co, Sobeys in Canada and Coles in Australia – slowing the rollout of automated warehouses.Ocado's first-half losses were also better than expected in the market.It insisted it had a ""clear road map"" to deliver positive cash flow in 2025-26.The results come a day after shares in Ocado tumbled after an analyst downgraded his outlook on the stock, saying he believed the online group may need to raise more cash.Shares in the group fallen sharply over the past six months, down by nearly 40%.Tim Steiner , chief executive of Ocado, admitted that online grocery shopping was growing at a slower pace than expected at at the height of the pandemic, which has seen some of it global customers pause expansion.But he insisted it was still the fastest growing shopping channel and said the setbacks would not impact its goal of turning a pre-tax profit within five years.He said: ""We have come through an unprecedented period for online grocery, with multiple years of high food inflation following a surge in demand during the pandemic.""The global channel shift to online has now resumed and Ocado is uniquely well-positioned to take advantage of the opportunity.""He said the group continues to ""engage constructively"" with Ocado Retail partner M&amp;S as it looks to agree a settlement in a row over payments between the businesses.M&amp;S is due to pay Ocado a final instalment of £190.7 million as part of the payment for the £750 million 50-50 tie-up between the businesses, Ocado Retail, which was launched in 2019.But the joint venture has failed to meet performance targets, leading to negotiations between the pair, with Ocado saying in February that it could take legal action against M&amp;S over the payment.Mr Steiner said he would not give further details on the talks, which he said were ""confidential"".In its first half, Ocado Retail saw price inflation ease back to 1.5%, which it said was ""well below"" the 4.4% seen in the wider sector.Despite this, the average basket value lifted by 1.8% to £123, it said.Ocado said it would keep a tight lid on costs and said that while in the longer term it would likely have fewer staff, it had no immediate plans for job cuts.""To bring down our costs over the longer term, we'll emerge with less people than we have today,"" Mr Steiner said.Copyright © 2024 independent.co.uk",2024-07-16,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240716:nNRAt9h100:1,Ocado,social

This is where our Nourish the Nation programme comes into play, with the aim of turning the school holiday experience from one of surviving to thriving,"" said Ruth Cranston, director of Corporate Responsibility &amp; Sustainability at Sainsbury's.""In total this spring and summer, we will have committed to donating over £4.2m to supporting children with access to nutritious food, through donations to Comic Relief. We hope that all the funding will help towards building lasting change for these children and their families.""The collaboration marks the 25th anniversary of Sainsbury's and Comic Relief's partnership, a testament to their enduring commitment to supporting communities across the UK.To date, Sainsbury's says it has raised more than £170m for Comic Relief.Copyright © 2024 MarketLine",2024-07-16,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240716:nNRAt9pe2u:1,Sainsburys,esg

Sainsbury's, a major UK supermarket chain, is reducing plastic waste with a significant revamp of its fish and chicken packaging.These changes are expected to eliminate nearly 700 tonnes (t) of plastic annually.The centrepiece of the initiative involves switching all own-brand salmon and trout fillet trays to pulp cardboard.This material, made from sugarcane pulp, boasts a 70% reduction in plastic compared to traditional options.Additionally, these trays are recyclable at home, simplifying waste management for customers.Sainsbury's is also replacing plastic trays with cardboard alternatives for all fresh breaded chicken products under its own-brand and 'Taste the Difference' line.This change extends to breaded fish fillets within the 'Taste the Difference' range as well.These improvements align with Sainsbury's commitment to minimise plastic packaging and enhance recyclability across its product lines.The eco-friendly packaging rollout will continue throughout the mid-year period, encompassing many seasonal favourites in Sainsbury's finger food and BBQ ranges.""We are now the first retailer to make the move to have recycled pulp card trays across all our by Sainsbury's and Taste the Difference salmon products, enabling a whopping 70% plastic reduction,"" commented Claire Hughes, Sainsbury's director of product and innovation.To assist its customers in identifying more sustainable products, Sainsbury's recently launched the 'Good to Know' logo. This logo highlights products with reduced plastic packaging, among other sustainability features.It also aims to educate customers about the company's sustainability efforts and progress towards its Plan for Better ambitions.The Good to Know logo will be displayed on the new packaging for Sainsbury's salmon products.These announcements represent the latest in a series of changes implemented by Sainsbury's to decrease plastic usage in its own-brand packaging.Previous initiatives include replacing plastic steak trays with cardboard alternatives and eliminating plastic punnets for its mushrooms.Copyright © 2024 MarketLine",2024-06-12,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240612:nNRAsy9aft:1,Sainsburys,sustainability

"More than 20,000 Tesco workers are set to share a £30 million windfall from maturing share schemes.The company revealed that the employees will receive the bumper payout following a ""strong performance"" from its Save as You Earn colleague share schemes.It said it will be mainly workers on its store shopfloors and in its distribution centres who benefit from the cash boost.Workers have benefited from the recent improvement in the FTSE 100 group's share price, which currently sits above 303p after a 20% increase over the past year.Employees who joined the schemes can buy shares at a discounted price, of 188p or 198p each, and either keep them for the longer term or sell on for a profit.Those who invested the maximum £500 a month into the savings schemes stand to make a profit of almost £10,000 from the three-year scheme and almost £20,000 from the five-year scheme.Tesco said there was an average employee investment of £68 a month in the scheme.Emma Taylor, Tesco chief people officer, said: ""It's great news that more than 20,000 colleagues will benefit this year from our share schemes.""This is just one of the many benefits available to our colleagues, and the strong performance of the schemes this year is a reflection of their hard work and the brilliant job that they do serving our customers every day.""Colleagues tell us they like this way of saving every month – and when Tesco performs well, they share in a multi-million pound payout or can keep shares bought at a discounted rate.""This year the schemes' success is rewarding our colleagues with thousands of pounds in profit, helping to boost their savings for everything from holidays to house renovations.""Read MoreAer Lingus forced to cancel 76 additional flights as pay row rumbles onAI driving rise in Google's greenhouse gas emissions, says companyHawksmoor eyes sale deal worth reported £100mCopyright © 2024 independent.co.uk",2024-07-03,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240703:nNRAt5f5ok:1,Tesco,esg
"The UK's biggest supermarket chain, Tesco, faced criticism over its chief executive's near- £10m pay deal at its annual shareholder meeting on Friday.The campaign groups ShareAction and the High Pay Centre both questioned why Ken Murphy's pay had more than doubled to £9.9m including bonuses, when some of those working in its supermarkets do not receive the real living wage.""Can the board explain why it is comfortable with chief executive pay doubling last year to 430 times [that of the] average employee and not comfortable with providing third-party contracted workers such as cleaners and security guards with the real living wage,"" Peter, a Share Action activist, asked at the meeting.A member of the High Pay Centre said Murphy's pay in relation to ordinary workers was ""one of the most extreme pay ratios in the FTSE 100"".Although the majority of store workers get the independently verified living wage – which is higher than the legal minimum – ShareAction claims contracted staff, such as cleaners and security, do not.Murphy said on Friday: ""I accept I am well paid. My remuneration is set by the board as delegated by shareholders. Over two-thirds of it is variable and dependent on reaching long-term financial goals.""He added that Tesco had made ""record investments"" in pay for ordinary workers over the past two years. He said he was ""really proud of [the] fact we are a leading employer in terms of our total package for colleagues"" and that Tesco was ""not unduly worried"" by Labour's plans for improved workers' rights as it already had in place many of the measures expected to be implemented if the party wins power.Gerry Murphy, Tesco's chairman, later told the annual shareholder meeting that the company was recruiting in a global market for executives and ""the fact is we have to be competitive"".However, Dan Howard, the head of good work at ShareAction, said: ""In a world where Tesco are making a £2.3bn profit a year, paying those who keep the stores safe and clean the real living wage shouldn't have to be asked for – it should be automatic.""Unfortunately, Tesco are dragging their feet on taking the right steps to pay its third-party contracted staff the living wage.""Failing to recognise the financial hardship many of those who work for Tesco have faced during the cost of living crisis will damage Tesco's reputation with both shareholders and customers.""On Friday, Tesco, which owns the Booker wholesaler and supermarkets in Ireland and mainland Europe as well as UK supermarkets and convenience stores, said it continued to win over shoppers from its rivals with sales up 5.3% at its UK chain and 4.5% overall.Murphy said inflation was continuing to ease and was now less than 3%. He added that he expected it to remain at that level for the remainder of the year despite a rise in shipping costs, linked to problems in the Red Sea, and poor weather in the UK and Europe, which is affecting crops.He said the British strawberry season had been delayed and the asparagus season had been shorter than hoped but there were no shortages as Tesco had made ""alternative arrangements"".Murphy added there was a ""gentle ongoing improvement in customer sentiment"" in the UK helped by a rise in the legal minimum wage that was ahead of inflation.However, he admitted that sales of nonfood items were weaker than food as the wet and cold weather continued to affect demand for summer clothing, barbecue kit and other seasonal items.Copyright (c) 2024 theguardian.com-NonSyndicated",2024-06-14,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240614:nNRAsyvlbz:21,Tesco,esg

"Tesco has been accused of giving struggling workers a ""slap in the face"" after the UK supermarket's boss earned almost £10m last year as profits soared during the cost of living crisis.Ken Murphy was given £9.9m in pay and perks, more than double the previous year and thought to be the most ever for a Tesco boss, beating £7m-plus paydays for the former chief executive Sir Terry Leahy.More than half of Murphy's payout relates to a long-term bonus worth three times his basic salary paid in shares that must be held for at least two years. A further £3.4m annual bonus is linked to sales, profits and individual objectives, according to Tesco's annual shareholder report, which was published on Tuesday.The increase in total pay means that Murphy now earns more than 430 times the average pay at Tesco, up from a multiple of 197 in the previous year. He is one of the best-paid executives among the leading FTSE 100-listed companies, although still well behind the £18.7m that the best paid – the AstraZeneca boss Pascal Soriot – could earn this year.Tesco, which owns the Booker grocery wholesaler and runs stores in eastern Europe and the Republic of Ireland as well as the UK, last month revealed pre-tax profits had soared by 159% to £2.3bn – the highest in more than a decade – in the year to 24 February. Sales rose 7.4% to almost £61.5bn, led by strong expansion online and in large stores.Sharon Graham, the general secretary of the Unite union, said: ""Ken Murphy's £5m wage increase is a slap in the face to the millions of struggling workers and their families who paid for it through higher food bills. The fact is, Tesco has taken advantage of the cost of living crisis to rake in obscene profits, and it is far from the only one.""Luke Hildyard, the executive director of the High Pay Centre thinktank, added that Murphy's pay gap with a typical employee was the third highest since pay ratio reporting began five years ago.He said: ""You couldn't really get a better indicator of how the UK economy serves the interests of the super-rich at the expense of everybody else than this – a multimillionaire chief executive trousering another £10m while their customers endure major price rises and their employees have to get by on less than a quarter of a per cent of what the CEO takes home.""Murphy missed out on 5% of his potential annual bonus, or £176,000, after Tesco missed targets on cutting food waste, while his fixed pay slipped to £1.6m from £1.7m a year before, after the company stopped subsidising his commuting.Alison Platt, the chair of Tesco's remuneration committee, said Murphy's pay was benchmarked against pay for other FTSE 50 companies and other comparable international businesses. ""This pay award reflects the fact Tesco has delivered for all of its stakeholders over the last year – from its most competitive-ever customer offer to its record investment in colleague pay.""A large proportion of the total package has been achieved because the business met stretching targets in a highly competitive sector and worked to create value for customers, colleagues, suppliers, communities and shareholders.""This year, Murphy's basic salary rises 3% to £1.46m from £1.41m, so he could earn more than £9m again. The figures have emerged after Tesco was condemned by some staff as a month-long delay to a promised pay rise at the supermarket left them on less than the minimum wage, while saving the supermarket more than £17m.About 220,000 staff shared a £70m ""thank you"" payment after the rise in profits, equivalent to 1.5% of annual pay, with a full-time shop worker expected to receive about £300.The report also shows long-term share bonus payouts for the former boss of Tesco Dave Lewis and the former finance director Alan Stewart, who received shares worth almost £1.6m and £1.7m respectively in the past year based on performance while they were in the business.Copyright (c) 2024 theguardian.com-NonSyndicated",2024-05-14,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240514:nNRAsnt1xe:35,Tesco,esg
"Tesco boss Ken Murphy has seen his pay deal more than double, up to almost £10 million for the past year.It means the chief executive has been paid 431 times the wage of the average Tesco worker at £23,010.The supermarket giant's annual report revealed Mr Murphy received a pay package worth £9.93 million for the year to February.It compared with a £4.44 million total pay deal for the previous financial year.Mr Murphy's latest deal was driven by £4.91 million from his performance share plan (PSP) after helping led the company to higher profits in the face of a challenging inflation backdrop.This PSP payment will be paid out in Tesco shares and is based on the company's performance since 2021.It comes on top of an annual salary of £1.64 million and annual bonus of £3.38 million.Meanwhile, the group's chief finance officer, Imran Nawaz, also saw his annual pay package more than double.He received a total pay deal of £4.95 million for the year, jumping from £2.27 million in the previous financial year.It came after Tesco last month posted an adjusted operating profit of £2.83 billion for the year to February, up almost 13% on the previous year.However, the retailer came under criticism at the time for revealing the bumper profits when many customers had been impacted by rampant food and drink inflation, which soared in the face of supply chain disruption and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Alison Platt, chairwoman of the Tesco remuneration committee, said: ""This pay award reflects the fact Tesco has delivered for all of its stakeholders over the last year – from its most competitive-ever customer offer, to its record investment in colleague pay.""It also recognises the strong performance of the business while at the same time reflecting the complexities of managing a business of the size and scale of Tesco.""A large proportion of the total package has been achieved because the business met stretching targets in a highly competitive sector and worked to create value for customers, colleagues, suppliers, communities and shareholders.""Tesco remains committed to a competitive and fair reward package for all colleagues and over the last two years we have invested more than £800 million in colleague pay, as well as significantly enhancing the range of wellbeing benefits we offer.""Copyright (c) 2024 Independent.co.uk",2024-05-14,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240514:nNRAsnq0av:7,Tesco,esg
"Marks &amp; Spencer has suspended a free-range egg farm as a supplier after seeing footage there of a living hen hanging upside down, as well as sick hens alongside living ones.It was one of four free-range farms that had RSPCA endorsement where animal welfare advocates filmed inside. Together, the four sold eggs to Marks &amp; Spencer, Tesco and Asda, as well as the Happy Egg Company.The activists said they saw ""appalling"" conditions with suffering and dying birds.Each farm had sick, dying and dead hens alongside living ones, according to the activists – but they warned that the scenes were ""a distressing norm in the free-range egg industry"".Animal rights charity Animal Justice Project (AJP), which shot footage at the farms between December and February, said its investigation laid bare claims of high welfare as a facade. The RSPCA suspended another of the four after seeing the footage.The most shocking discovery, according to AJP, was a hen hanging upside down on Home Farm in Lincolnshire, which was an A-listed supplier for M&amp;S via egg company Bumble Hole Foods.""She was struggling to free herself from a hazardous slatted system, with other birds already dead and hanging off tiers,"" an AJP spokesperson said.""The situation was exacerbated by insanitary conditions throughout the farm. In the packing room rat poison had been 'haphazardly scattered' and a dead mouse lay among the filth.""Home Farm cancelled its RSPCA Assured membership in February, although filming had taken place two months earlier.Bumble Hole Foods says it sources eggs from farms accredited for their hygiene standards and chicken welfare.The witness said they also saw distressed animals with splayed legs, birds with bad feather loss, decomposing bodies and overcrowded nesting areas.M&amp;S suspended the farm when The Independent showed the chain the footage.The other three farms still had RSPCA Assured endorsement when filming took place, but on seeing the footage, the charity suspended Ratford Farm in Wales, where the activist saw ""run-down facilities and instances of neglect"".In sheds that housed more than 14,000 birds, one hen was filmed with an apparently twisted neck, dead hens were filmed on the floor, and one hen had severe diarrhoea, it was claimed.Conditions were also ""disturbing"", it's claimed, at Glenrath Farms in Scotland, owned by an ""egg dynasty"" and one of the UK's largest producers of free-range eggs that produces more than a million eggs daily for Tesco and Asda.Animal Justice Project said it saw ""sick hens in filthy conditions showing signs of severe distress"" such as twisted beaks, swollen feet and panting.""The stench of ammonia filled the air, and numerous deceased hens were scattered throughout the premises – in one area, seven lifeless birds lay together, their necks seemingly broken before they were discarded,"" the spokesperson said.""Central nesting areas were deliberately blocked off, depriving hens of essential spaces to rest and lay eggs, and 'enrichment' efforts, represented by plastic bucket lids and mesh scraps, remained untouched.""During each visit in February, drone footage showed the birds were denied access to the outdoors for four consecutive days, with 'pop holes' sealed shut.""Over half of the respondents in a YouGov poll for Animal Justice Project said they believed free-range hens had daily access to outdoors.In 2022, a director of Glenrath Farms won an award from the Poultry Club of Scotland.At a Tesco-supplying farm in the East Midlands, which provides eggs for The Happy Egg Co, a brand synonymous with ""ethical"" egg production, Animal Justice Project said it documented cases of severe prolapses, wings that looked broken, and widespread feather loss.Dying and decaying birds were allegedly seen on shed floors.Sean Barrs, an Animal Justice Project campaigner, said: ""Today's modern egg industry in Britain unveils a heartbreaking truth: sick, dying, and live hanging egg-laying hens, crammed by the thousands into huge, factory-style sheds designed for maximum production.""Even RSPCA Assured certification fails to shield these birds from suffering, despite the organisation's mission claiming to advocate for 'every kind of animal'.""An M&amp;S spokesperson said: ""The footage shows unacceptable levels of welfare which fall well below the rigorous standards we set for all our suppliers. We have immediately suspended the farm [Home Farm in Lincolnshire] from our supply chain while we urgently investigate with RSPCA Assured.""A Glenrath spokesperson said bird welfare was a priority, adding: ""We're disappointed animal activists chose to break into our farm, causing a significant biosecurity and disease risk. It is a criminal offence to break into a secure property.""It looks as though the activists were in the shed whilst the birds were resting, which would cause them to become upset and distressed. When birds are resting nest boxes are routinely closed.""Whilst a misshapen beak is unfortunate and the industry makes great efforts to ensure accurate beak trimming, occasionally some birds do still have misaligned beaks."" There was no indication birds were struggling to feed or drink, they said.Questioning whether birds became lame or died because of intruders, they said a vet who inspected the hens detected no welfare issues.But the investigators said they did nothing illegal, having got in through an unlocked door and a damaged ""pop hole"" – which they said they filmed.They also put on coveralls and booties so posed no biosecurity risk, which was also videoed, AJP said.An RSPCA Assured spokesperson said: ""This footage is very distressing to watch and we launched an investigation as soon as we were made aware of it.""As part of that investigation, RSPCA Assured assessors have made unannounced inspections of the three farms that are members of the RSPCA Assured scheme. We've also analysed the footage to identify any breaches of the RSPCA welfare standards.""We can confirm that we have suspended one of the farms, pending further investigation. This means they cannot market or sell any products under the RSPCA Assured label. Our investigation into the other two farms is ongoing and we are unable to comment further at this time.""A fourth farm shown in the footage cancelled its membership in February, so we are unable to investigate.""Sadly, from time to time things can go wrong on farms, but one case of poor welfare is still one too many, which is why we have taken these allegations very seriously.""Asda aligned itself with the response of the British Retail Consortium (BRC), which represents all supermarkets. Andrew Opie, of the BRC, said members worked closely with trusted suppliers to ensure high welfare standards were upheld. ""They have strict processes in place and will thoroughly investigate evidence of welfare breaches,"" he said.The Independent asked Tesco to comment but did not receive a reply.A spokesperson for Noble Foods, which owns The Happy Egg Company, said: ""At The Happy Egg Co, the care and wellbeing of all our hens is a top priority and our agricultural team runs a robust schedule of regular farm visits, which includes spot checks from third parties to ensure they meet our stringent welfare standards.""As soon as we were shown this footage featuring one of our farms, we launched an immediate review. Our team assessed the farm, and the RSPCA carried out an independent and unannounced assessment on Monday 29 April, where the farm was found to be fully compliant with industry regulations and best practices. The RSPCA had previously visited the farm only two weeks prior and has found no cause for concern at either visit.""The British Free Range Egg Producer Association was asked to comment on behalf of Ratford Farm, as well as Home Farm, which also did not respond to requests to comment. Nor did Bumble Hole Foods respond to requests to comment.Copyright (c) 2024 Independent.co.uk",2024-05-09,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240509:nNRAsm763a:30,Tesco,esg
"Inventors hope to crack how to create a reliable clean water supply on the moon – and it may involve a microwave oven from Tesco.The goal to set up a crewed lunar base was launched many moons ago but has yet to come to fruition. With reliance on water supplies from Earth risky and expensive, one of the many challenges is how to extract and purify water from ice lying in craters at the lunar south pole.Such a supply would not only provide a resource for drinking and growing crops, but the water could also be split into hydrogen, for use as rocket fuel, and oxygen for residents to breathe.Now the UK Space Agency has announced that it is awarding £30,000 in seed funding, with expert support, to each of 10 UK teams who are vying to solve the problem.Lolan Naicker of Naicker Scientific Ltd, one of the UK finalists of the Aqualunar Challenge, said throwing open the conundrum to the public allows people with very different approaches to problem-solving, and very different backgrounds, to put forward potential answers.""It's extremely difficult to actually come up with a viable solution,"" he said.Naicker added that the first part of his team's plan is to microwave the dirty lunar ice. ""I'm literally going to go out today, buy a microwave oven from Tesco across the road, and strip it down, take out the magnetron and then try to incorporate that into the first part of my process,"" he said.Naicker and his team members are working on a ""SonoChem System"" that will use powerful sound waves to generate millions of tiny bubbles in lunar water, within which high temperatures and pressures are produced. That, Naicker said, produces highly reactive substances known as free radicals that break down contaminants in the water.But while the team have a core idea, there is much more to do.""Remember, we need to get from this dirty ice to liquid water first. And we need to do this in an environment that's -200C – it's vacuum conditions,"" he said.The teams only have seven months to develop their ideas before a winner and two runners-up are chosen in spring 2025, with the selected trio to share a further £300,000 to continue work on their solutions. In addition, approximately £600,000 is being dedicated to rewarding solutions from Canadian-led teams.Meganne Christian, a UK Space Agency reserve astronaut and chair of the Aqualunar Challenge judging panel, said it is early days for Nasa's Artemis mission, supported by the European Space Agency and others, which aims to put humans back on the moon.""So it's the right moment to have innovators looking into how to purify water on the moon – and to be fair, we didn't actually know that there was water on the moon until relatively recently,"" she said.Christian added that the Aqualunar Challenge – which is funded by the UK Space Agency's International Bilateral Fund and managed by Challenge Works in collaboration with the Canadian Space Agency – has a hugely diverse range of finalists, with teams also considering how the technologies could be applied on Earth.Naicker said his team has a number of plans. ""We could build a slightly bigger system, put it on the back of a van and drive it out to a war-torn area,"" he said. ""We could develop smaller appliances for the developing world where access to clean water is really challenging.""Christian added the idea is that the new technologies could be also used on other space missions where there is water ice.""We know that there's water ice on Mars, for example. So absolutely, these technologies could be adapted for use on Mars and other planetary bodies, wherever we decide to go in the future,"" she said.The nine other UK finalists in the Aqualunar Challenge include:Nascent Semiconductor Ltd , which is developing a compact system called the Titania-Diamond Annular Reactor (TiDAR). This will break down contaminants in lunar soil using a titanium dioxide catalyst activated by LED-based UV light with diamond electrodes.The British Interplanetary Society in London , which has come up with Ganymede's Chalice – a device in which a curved mirror focuses the Sun's rays on an air-locked crucible containing lunar ice. The components within the ice can then be boiled in turn, and stored.Queen Mary University of London , whose team is creating AquaLunarPure: a reactor that heats lunar ice to leave behind solid material then heats it to more than 373C at 220 bars of pressure to turn it into ""supercritical water"", whereby contaminants are removed by oxidation.Minima Design Ltd, Suffolk , which has developed a Cyclic Volatile Extractor (CVE) – in which dirty ice is heated within a novel closed chamber under variable pressures, allowing different contaminants to be removed and stored.RedSpace Ltd , which has come up with Frank, a Filtered Regolith Aqua Neutralisation Kit, in which lunar soil is heated to remove volatile gases before the remaining material is passed through a membrane to separate solid particles and liquid. The latter is then distilled to obtain water.Perspective Space-Tech Ltd , which has created an innovative lunar water resource system called I-LUNASYS, in which lunar samples are heated to remove impurities as gas. Reverse osmosis is then used to separate water molecules from the sample, with the final step involving a UV filtration system.Shaun Fletcher and Dr Lukman Yusuf from the University of Glasgow , who plan to melt dirty ice, remove large soil particles and then pump the water through an ultrasound system.

Tesco, the UK's supermarket group, has initiated a trial to use laser etching on avocados instead of sticking them with plastic labels, Reuters reported.This approach, intended to cut down plastic waste, involves the use of high-powered lasers to inscribe details such as the fruit's size or variety on its skin. The trial is currently underway in approximately 270 stores in south-east England, with plans for a nationwide rollout if customer feedback is favourable.  The initiative could potentially eliminate the use of nearly one million plastic stickers annually for Tesco's loose, extra-large avocados, according to Reuters. Westfalia Fruit, Tesco's primary avocado supplier from Lincolnshire, is collaborating on this initiative.  Westfalia Fruit general manager Graham Isaac was quoted by the Guardian as saying: ""We are confident that, with a clear focus and united effort as an industry, we will be able to significantly reduce our waste, use natural resources responsibly and protect the environment and biodiversity for all our futures."" In addition to the laser labelling, Tesco is also experimenting with replacing plastic tray packaging for two popular avocado lines with cardboard containers, which are more easily recycled.  If implemented, this change would save more than 20 million pieces of plastic tray packaging annually from just the twin-pack avocados. Tesco, which sells nearly 70 million avocados each year, is working towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, including emissions from its operations, products, and supply chains. Besides Tesco, Marks &amp; Spencer previously conducted similar trials with its supplier, Mack, in Kent, in 2017, and tested it with oranges.  Laser Food, a Spanish company, has also explored this technology on various fruits, ranging from coconuts to apples, the Guardian reported. Last month, Tesco Ireland revealed plans to use a new, more sustainable packaging format for its range of fresh mince meat products. Copyright © 2024 MarketLine",2024-06-06,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240606:nNRAswdb7q:1,Tesco,environment
"Tesco is testing the etching or ""tattooing"" of avocados as a way to cut out the millions of plastic stickers used to label them.The retailer said is was working with a fruit supplier, Westphalia, to scrap the stickers currently used on its extra large avocados and replace them with a laser etching, in a trial launched this month.Tesco, the UK's largest supermarket which sells almost 70m avocados a year, said the scheme would save the use of almost a million plastic stickers on the large version of the fruit, where the technology will be first used.The computer-guided lasers remove a tiny layer from the top of the avocado skin to etch information in less than a second. The process leaves a design that communicates the size or variety of the fruit to customers.The test will take place in about 270 Tesco stores in south-east England and, if feedback from customers is positive, will be rolled out across the group.Under the scheme, Tesco is also testing a switch from plastic trays to more easily recyclable cardboard on some twin-packs of avocados, which could ultimately save more than 20m pieces of plastic a year.Sales of avocados are up by 15% year on year at Tesco, despite concerns about their carbon footprint and fears about ethical standards on farms.Graham Isaac, the general manager of Westfalia Fruit, said: ""We are confident that, with a clear focus and untied effort as an industry, we will be able to significantly reduce our waste, use natural resources responsibly and protect the environment and biodiversity for all our futures.""Tesco is not the first retailer to test the idea of tattooing labels on to avocados. Marks &amp; Spencer tried out a similar idea with a supplier, Mack, based in Kent, in 2017 and tested it on oranges several years earlier. Its partner, the Spanish company Laser Food, has tested the technology on a range of fruits, from coconuts to apples.Copyright (c) 2024 theguardian.com-NonSyndicated",2024-05-31,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240531:nNRAsu4fck:1,Tesco,environment

"Inventors hope to crack how to create a reliable clean water supply on the moon – and it may involve a microwave oven from Tesco.The goal to set up a crewed lunar base was launched many moons ago but has yet to come to fruition. With reliance on water supplies from Earth risky and expensive, one of the many challenges is how to extract and purify water from ice lying in craters at the lunar south pole.Such a supply would not only provide a resource for drinking and growing crops, but the water could also be split into hydrogen, for use as rocket fuel, and oxygen for residents to breathe.Now the UK Space Agency has announced that it is awarding £30,000 in seed funding, with expert support, to each of 10 UK teams who are vying to solve the problem.Lolan Naicker of Naicker Scientific Ltd, one of the UK finalists of the Aqualunar Challenge, said throwing open the conundrum to the public allows people with very different approaches to problem-solving, and very different backgrounds, to put forward potential answers.""It's extremely difficult to actually come up with a viable solution,"" he said.Naicker added that the first part of his team's plan is to microwave the dirty lunar ice. ""I'm literally going to go out today, buy a microwave oven from Tesco across the road, and strip it down, take out the magnetron and then try to incorporate that into the first part of my process,"" he said.Naicker and his team members are working on a ""SonoChem System"" that will use powerful sound waves to generate millions of tiny bubbles in lunar water, within which high temperatures and pressures are produced. That, Naicker said, produces highly reactive substances known as free radicals that break down contaminants in the water.But while the team have a core idea, there is much more to do.""Remember, we need to get from this dirty ice to liquid water first. And we need to do this in an environment that's -200C – it's vacuum conditions,"" he said.The teams only have seven months to develop their ideas before a winner and two runners-up are chosen in spring 2025, with the selected trio to share a further £300,000 to continue work on their solutions. In addition, approximately £600,000 is being dedicated to rewarding solutions from Canadian-led teams.Meganne Christian, a UK Space Agency reserve astronaut and chair of the Aqualunar Challenge judging panel, said it is early days for Nasa's Artemis mission, supported by the European Space Agency and others, which aims to put humans back on the moon.""So it's the right moment to have innovators looking into how to purify water on the moon – and to be fair, we didn't actually know that there was water on the moon until relatively recently,"" she said.Christian added that the Aqualunar Challenge – which is funded by the UK Space Agency's International Bilateral Fund and managed by Challenge Works in collaboration with the Canadian Space Agency – has a hugely diverse range of finalists, with teams also considering how the technologies could be applied on Earth.Naicker said his team has a number of plans. ""We could build a slightly bigger system, put it on the back of a van and drive it out to a war-torn area,"" he said. ""We could develop smaller appliances for the developing world where access to clean water is really challenging.""Christian added the idea is that the new technologies could be also used on other space missions where there is water ice.""We know that there's water ice on Mars, for example. So absolutely, these technologies could be adapted for use on Mars and other planetary bodies, wherever we decide to go in the future,"" she said.The nine other UK finalists in the Aqualunar Challenge include:Nascent Semiconductor Ltd , which is developing a compact system called the Titania-Diamond Annular Reactor (TiDAR). This will break down contaminants in lunar soil using a titanium dioxide catalyst activated by LED-based UV light with diamond electrodes.The British Interplanetary Society in London , which has come up with Ganymede's Chalice – a device in which a curved mirror focuses the Sun's rays on an air-locked crucible containing lunar ice. The components within the ice can then be boiled in turn, and stored.Queen Mary University of London , whose team is creating AquaLunarPure: a reactor that heats lunar ice to leave behind solid material then heats it to more than 373C at 220 bars of pressure to turn it into ""supercritical water"", whereby contaminants are removed by oxidation.Minima Design Ltd, Suffolk , which has developed a Cyclic Volatile Extractor (CVE) – in which dirty ice is heated within a novel closed chamber under variable pressures, allowing different contaminants to be removed and stored.RedSpace Ltd , which has come up with Frank, a Filtered Regolith Aqua Neutralisation Kit, in which lunar soil is heated to remove volatile gases before the remaining material is passed through a membrane to separate solid particles and liquid. The latter is then distilled to obtain water.Perspective Space-Tech Ltd , which has created an innovative lunar water resource system called I-LUNASYS, in which lunar samples are heated to remove impurities as gas. Reverse osmosis is then used to separate water molecules from the sample, with the final step involving a UV filtration system.Shaun Fletcher and Dr Lukman Yusuf from the University of Glasgow , who plan to melt dirty ice, remove large soil particles and then pump the water through an ultrasound system. This will remove gases, destroy pollutants and clump together any lunar dust, before the water is filtered to remove remaining contaminants.Regolithix Ltd , who are developing a Regolith Ice Plasma Purifier for Lunar Exploration (RIPPLE), in which dirty lunar ice will be heated, with water vapour and solid particles separated by a device akin to a salad spinner.

IKEA UK country customer fulfilment manager Jakob Bertilsson said: ""The opening of our first mobile pick-up point in Scotland and our one-hundredth across the UK marks an exciting moment for our journey to become more accessible. As we continue to see a shift in our visitors, [who wish] to shop even more conveniently, we need to constantly develop and improve with better and more affordable services. ""Our ambitions to double our Click &amp; Collect offering, combined with the strengthening of services such as IKEA Home Delivery, means we are now closer than ever to people in all parts of the UK."" The retailer's nationwide expansion plan focuses on creating a more accessible shopping experience, with the mobile pick-up point network at Tesco a central component of this initiative. Customers can access the mobile pick-up service by ordering through IKEA's website or app, or with the help of an IKEA co-worker. Orders are ready for collection from the next day from collection windows at participating Tescos. In addition to mobile pick-up points, IKEA offers collection services at over 10,000 DPD points in the UK and provides same-day, free click-and-collect from its stores in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and the Aberdeen Order and Collection point.

".storyContent .bwalignc.storyContent .bwlistdecimalJuniper Research: Tesco Mobile Ranks as the Top UK Mobile Operator for Customer Satisfaction in 2024
A new survey from Juniper Research, the foremost experts in the telecommunications market, ranked Tesco Mobile as the leading network operator in the UK for customer satisfaction in 2024. The comprehensive survey of 3,300 UK mobile subscribers assessed attitudes towards their chosen network operators and the services they provide.


According to the study, the top five mobile operators providing the highest overall customer satisfaction, measured by net promoter score, are ranked as follows:


Tesco Mobile – 92%


giffgaff – 91%


EE – 86%


iD Mobile – 86%


Sky Mobile – 85%


An extract of the new report, UK Mobile Operator Consumer Satisfaction Survey 2024, is now available as a free download.

Price &amp; Coverage Drive Tesco to Top Spot
While Tesco Mobile ranked first for overall customer satisfaction, the survey found Tesco Mobile subscribers are most satisfied with the cost of their subscription and geographical coverage provided. This contrasts with overall responses, as these two factors were the most reported causes of customer dissatisfaction from all subscribers.

Economic Pressures Diminishing Value for Money
Consumer inflation in the UK has increased pressure on subscribers to minimise outgoings, including their mobile contracts. Mobile subscribers are much more open to low-cost subscription offers and deals on handsets.


To capitalise on these findings, the report recommends operators expand their contract offers to cater to lower-spending subscribers.


Report author Elisha Sudlow-Poole commented: “The survey results show economic downturns of the last few years in the UK have impacted how subscribers approach their connectivity needs. It is evident operators in the UK must reassess their offerings to address this desire for low-cost service in the face of changing consumer demands.”About the Research Suite
The study, conducted in April 2024, surveyed 3,300 mobile subscribers across the UK; assessing their experiences with eight leading UK mobile operators. All calculations were performed at a 95% confidence interval. This report and accompanying excel contains the full analysis, and over 16,600 market statistics.

Description: Sainsbury's, Britain's second largest supermarket group, reported a 3% rise in first-quarter underlying sales on Tuesday, though weather-related weakness in non-food areas partially offset robust demand for groceries. Francis Maguire reports.

Video Transcript:
Sainsbury saw a 3% rise in first quarter underlying sales. But Britain's second largest supermarket group also endured weather-related weakness in non-food areas. And that offsets strong demand for groceries. The group said food sales rose 4.8% over the 16 weeks to June 22. But general merchandise and clothing sales fell 4.3%, and sales at the group's Argos catalogue retail business dropped even more. It all reflected both poor early summer weather and the strength of sales last year. Sainsbury said it still expected full-year retail operating profit of up to $1.34 billion, which would be up on last year. Last week, rival Tesco reported a 4.6% rise in first quarter underlying sales. It and Sainsbury's have pulled away from competitors like Asda and Morrisons, who were dealing with high debts. Sainsbury shares were down over 4% after Tuesday's update.(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.

"Tesco and Asda are being sued by customers, including the family of an 11-year-old girl, who were left seriously ill after eating own-brand sandwiches linked to an outbreak of E coli .The supermarkets face legal action after a child and adult were left in hospital. One person has been confirmed to have died and more than 120 others including a six-year-old have been hospitalised in the UK due to the bacteria.Several food manufacturers have recalled sandwiches, wraps and salads sold in big supermarkets and retail chains over fears that they are linked to the outbreak. The Food Standards Agency has previously said lettuce used in the products was thought to be the likely source of the outbreak.The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said in a briefing on Thursday that two people in England died within 28 days of infection with Shiga toxin-producing E coli (Stec).""Based on the information available from health service clinicians, one of these deaths is likely linked to their Stec infection,"" the agency said. ""Both individuals had underlying medical conditions. The deaths occurred in May.""One victim, whose family is suing Asda, is an 11-year-old girl from the north-west. She became seriously ill and was hospitalised and on dialysis for almost three weeks after eating their chicken salad sandwich.She was discharged two days ago, but could be at risk of permanent kidney damage. Her mother bought three of the sandwiches as part of an online delivery, a legal letter states.The child developed haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), a clinical syndrome associated with Stec that can lead to kidney failure and death.Claire Glasgow, of the legal firm Fieldfisher, which is representing the girl's family, said: ""Thankfully, she is now stable enough to return home, but HUS is a very serious condition that can cause permanent damage to the kidneys which can affect people for life.""Lawyers at Fieldfisher issued a letter of claim for breach of the Consumer Protection Act 1987 to Asda supermarket on behalf of the girl.Harvinder Kaur, a director at Fieldfisher, also issued a letter of claim to Tesco for breach of the same act on behalf of an adult male client from the south-east, who was also hospitalised with Ecoli symptoms after eating own-branded sandwiches containing salad.""Luckily, this client did not go on to develop HUS and is now home, but for a time he was seriously ill.

"Lawyers acting for two people who fell ill in the E. coli outbreak linked to salad leaves have started legal action against Tesco and Asda for compensation.Legal firm Fieldfisher told the PA news agency it has issued letters of claim for breach of the Consumer Protection Act over own-brand sandwiches purchased in the supermarkets.The claims relate to an 11-year-old girl from the North West and a man from the South East.The UK Health Security Agency said on Thursday one patient had died in the E. coli outbreak, which investigators believe is linked to salad used in sandwiches.Fieldfisher said the claim against Asda relates to the 11-year-old girl who contracted E. coli after eating an own-brand chicken salad sandwich bought at one of its stores.""The girl, aged 11, developed the serious condition haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), which attacks the kidneys and has been on dialysis for three weeks,"" it said.""She was discharged home two days ago but could be at risk of permanent kidney damage. Her mother bought three of the sandwiches as part of an online delivery.""A legal director at the firm, Harvinder Kaur, said she had issued a separate letter to Tesco on behalf of an adult man from the South East who was also hospitalised with E. coli symptoms after eating Tesco-branded sandwiches containing salad.""Luckily, this client did not go on to develop HUS and is now home, but for a time he was seriously ill,"" she said.""Under the Act, companies producing food must ensure it is safe to eat.""If it causes illness, it is a breach of their duty and those injured are eligible to claim compensation, not least to fund possible ongoing medical care.""My client was a regular shopper at Tesco, buying his lunch there most days since it was very close to his work.""An Asda spokesperson said: ""We have not yet received any letter from Fieldfisher regarding these claims, as soon as we do we will review the details of the claim as a matter of urgency.""It is understood that Tesco has not yet received notification of the claim from Fieldfisher.Several food manufacturers have recalled sandwiches, wraps and salads sold in major supermarkets and retail chains owing to the spread of E. coli.The UKHSA said the number of cases it is seeing is declining, but more will come to light as further samples are referred to it from NHS laboratories.So far, there have been 182 cases in England, 58 in Scotland, 31 in Wales and four in Northern Ireland. The latter cases are thought to have acquired their infection in England.At least 122 people have been admitted to hospital for treatment since the start of the outbreak.Darren Whitby, head of incidents at the FSA, said on Thursday it believed a type of lettuce used in sandwich products was the likely cause of the outbreak.He added: ""Although we are confident in the likely source of the outbreak being linked to lettuce, work continues to confirm this and identify the root cause of the outbreak with the growers, suppliers and manufacturers so that actions can be taken to prevent a re-occurrence.""E. coli is a diverse group of bacteria that are normally harmless and live in the intestines of humans and animals.However, some strains produce toxins that can make people very ill, such as shiga toxin-producing E. coli (Stec), which is the strain involved in this outbreak.People infected with Stec can suffer diarrhoea, and about 50% of cases have bloody diarrhoea.Other symptoms include stomach cramps and fever.Symptoms can last up to two weeks in uncomplicated cases.Some patients, mainly children, may develop HUS, which is a serious life-threatening condition resulting in kidney failure.A small proportion of adults may develop a similar condition called thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).Stec is often transmitted by eating contaminated food but can also be spread by close contact with an infected person, as well as direct contact with an infected animal or where it lives.People are advised to call NHS 111 or contact their GP surgery if they are worried about a baby under 12 months, a child stops breast or bottle feeding while they are ill, a child under five has signs of dehydration such as fewer wet nappies, and if older children or adults still have signs of dehydration after using oral rehydration sachets.Help should also be sought if people are being sick and cannot keep fluid down, there is bloody diarrhoea or bleeding from the bottom, diarrhoea lasts more than seven days, or vomiting for more than two days.Read MoreKeegan jokes about needing new job next week as pupils stage mock hustingsJK Rowling hits out at David Tennant after he says trans critics are 'whinging'Northern Ireland's Green Party 'here to call others out' – O'HaraElection - live: Police probe Reform campaigners' racist and homophobic slursSunak reveals anger as daughters forced to hear Reform activist call him racist slurTories' unfunded commitments could see mortgages rise – ReevesCopyright © 2024 independent.co.uk",2024-06-28,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240628:nNRAt3thzu:24,Tesco,social

Video Transcript:
&gt;&gt; Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today at Hatton Garden. We've made this as efficient as possible, so I'm going to get straight into the numbers. So we first set out our strategy to pivot profitability in July '22, and I'm pleased to present the results for the year ending March '24, which demonstrate the output of this strategy. Importantly, during the year, we've also been taking action to return us to growth, and in the final quarter, ao.com returned to revenue growth. We delivered our record ever group adjusted PBT of 34 million, up 22 million on the previous year, which is now at 3.3% of revenue. EPS was 4.29p per share, up over 380% year on year. And we're progressing towards our medium term PBT target of 5%. Going forward, I expect revenue growth will leverage overheads to improve this metric further. Gross margin's also improved and is now just over 23%. This growth comes as a result of the increased MDA product mix as well as an increase in the average product value, which has improved the amortization of delivery costs. This is further supported by our performance of our product protection plan customer base, and is on top of the benefit from delivery charges and range rationalization, as well as further efficiency savings in our logistics operation. There are some headwinds going into FY25 as latent inflationary pressures materialize, and we're working hard to mitigate the impact. Our cash has converted well to profits. CapEx was in line with our plan, albeit the decision to buy affordable mobiles and buy mobiles was an unforeseen opportunity. The actions we've taken to improve profitability resulted in a net revenue decrease year on year of about 9%, albeit ao.com grew in the final quarter of the year. Our MDA market share remains strong at over 15%, and the market's down about 1% year on year, which we anticipate is the bottom of the cycle. The increase in service revenue is driven mainly by the introduction of delivery charges and membership income. Commission revenue is made up of product protection plans and mobile phone contract sales. Our product protection plan customers continue to recognize the value and peace of mind it represents. And the volume of plans fell in line with retail sales, but the retention of customers improved, which has positively impacted profitability this year. Our mobile business has had a very difficult year. The new contract market was down about 14% year on year, which has been challenging as depressed customer demand place volume pressure on our volume commitments to networks. With that suppressed market, competition for customer's intensified, leading to increased expenditure in the acquisition of customers through affiliate channels and unsustainable discounts to try and achieve volume targets. Mobile remains a key part of our strategy. However, we could not feasibly continue to trade under the conditions seen in 2023. Therefore, at the start of the calendar year, we reset our approach. Firstly, we reengineered the business in partnership with the networks to remove the dysfunctionality so that our goals are aligned. And secondly, we strengthened our market position with the additional of affordable mobiles and buy mobiles. And we expect this to reduce the pressure on acquisition costs and to be a source of natural traffic. And then finally, we continue to leverage our logistics and recycling network for third party customers, where it doesn't distract from our core business. The actions we've discussed before on range and profit rationalization helped us to deliver record gross margin, a 23.4%, with margins in H2 being similar to H1. We've discussed that the mobile business has been impacted by shrinking market and the resultant competitive pressure, which has had a negative drag on overall margin. This was offset to some degree by the improvement in retention in our product protection plan base during the year. And we're committed to growing our retail business, and the improved customer offerings through finance, membership, new categories, and so on, will be a key part of that growth, and John's going to explain the strategy for that shortly. This changing mix will result in a slightly dilutive impact to gross margin in the coming financial year. So turning to our SG&amp;A costs, we've delivered savings of 19 million year-on-year and on a two-year basis of 65 million, firmly demonstrating the output of our pivot to profit. For the long-term benefit of the business, we have continued to invest in marketing. Although we have changed the focus of our spend away from direct acquisition towards brand investment as we look to cement our most trusted positioning with customers. As previously mentioned, the dynamics in mobile resulted in an increased cost of acquisition, which we don't expect to continue on a go-forward basis. In warehousing costs, we've delivered a number of efficiencies, which have contributed to us delivering not only a cash year-on-year saving, which you would expect with the decline in sales, but also an improvement in efficiency as we have reduced the cost as a percentage of sales too. Our overhead control has continued with a year-on-year saving of about nine million. The nature of some contracts means there has been a lag in the increase of some costs where inflationary pressures have continued to materialize despite the fall in the headline rate of inflation. We've experienced this as we exit FY24 and enter FY25, and government policy on minimum wage is driving high wage inflation in some of our lower-paid operational roles. We've also invested two million in the year in the first stage of our ERP implementation. The investment will continue and increase slightly in the coming two or three years as we ensure our systems and processes are resilient and scalable for future growth. So we've talked through our revenue and our cost lines, and I'm pleased with the PBT output, which shows year-on-year growth of 22 million, delivering PBT of 3.3%, which is up 2.2% versus the previous year. We remain focused on efficiency savings as we now turn our focus to growth. So profits converted to cash during the period. The swings we witnessed in working capital over the last couple of years have now normalized, and we've chosen to make some investments in inventory as we look to maximize availability for customers. This is particularly in slow-moving products, as well as those where manufacturer lead times can be long or inconsistent. And as a result, stock days have increased to 43. We've seen a cash inflow of about 28 million as a result of the reduction in trade receivables and the receivables of the mobile business, as well as tiding up the legacy of B2B. Trade and other payables have also fallen year-on-year. Now, this is largely a timing impact in the mobile business as purchasing cycles align themselves to sales. Investment in CapEx was eight million during the year with the key assets being the site for our recycling operation in Telford and the acquisition of the mobile IP. Now, we do expect to see CapEx increase into FY25 to about 11 million, and the increase largely being the purchase of vehicles, which are in their normal renewal cycle, but we will now likely buy those rather than we'd previously leased them. We've extended our Â£80 million revolving credit facility by another year to April 27, and KTHIS is on the same terms with our existing partners, and it's undrawn at the end of the year. As we exited FY 24, we saw ao.com return to growth and expect this trajectory to continue in the coming year. And John is going to cover the strategy for this shortly. We'll continue to leverage the fixed costs in our business although we do expect to see some short term inflation, which will proactively manage. Our expectations for the coming year is to deliver double digit growth and adjusted PBT between about 30,641 million, and our medium term aspirations remain unchanged to improve PBT margins towards 5%, to grow our revenue in double digits, and to grow our EPS faster than revenue. And on that positive note, I'll pass you to John. &gt;&gt; So as you've just seen in Mark's section, we've made real progress in improving our profitability and this is going to be a continuous journey, but the heavy lifting of that is firmly done. And with the benefit of hindsight, while many businesses were paralyzed by issues like working from home and cost inflation, and I think a lot of still waiting for that storm to pass, we're really glad that we had the courage of our convictions to take early decisive action. And I think that's the advantage of living through 24 years of storms that you really do learn how to dance in the rain. That said, the depth of the effort in getting to here should not at all be underestimated. And I'm really grateful to the entire AO team, our supplier partners, our shareholders for everyone's support over the last 18 months as we've gone through the journey. As a result, we've ended the year a much simpler business in a steady state, performing better than ever for customers with outstanding unit economics and crucially, our culture which underpins everything is firmly back and even stronger than ever post COVID. That's not to say that we won't get more profitable from here with growth, but the business foundations are now good, which is evidenced by today's numbers. Looking forward, our ambition is to be a double digit growth business every year for the next five years. Now, I know it's easy to be skeptical about this, especially in the current economic climate. So I just want to spend a little bit of time setting out the broad plan that underpins our confidence to achieve this ambition. Our approach is based entirely on self help. Taking share by offering customers a great proposition in a broadly flat market which will create operational gearing and any replacement cycle that may come from the COVID peak, that will be incremental. For context on the opportunity, our current share of the MDA market is around 15% give or take, and yet our share in all other categories is around 2% or less of the market. To manage your expectations though upfront, we won't be releasing all the micro details about our plans. Our overarching strategy is to create an even more loyal customer base and win a better share of wallet from total household spend in the electricals category. And we have a number of mechanisms to achieve this with a range of customer cohorts. During the COVID period, we transacted with around three million new customers, and they all had a fantastic first time experience with AO and with our brand at a time when they really needed us. We believe and we're seeing that they continue to repeat and buy new categories from us. And it's really important that we're already seeing this. We've taken the first steps in improving our proposition and fixing the unit economics of those other categories as well. Outside our MDA heritage, we're competing with a broader set of retailers both online and in store, where the reality is today is that we don't have an obvious right to win in those categories. what are we doing about that? We let's start by looking at those customer cohorts that we can build and how we can drive loyalty to AO. So, finance customers. Well, they give us a greater share of their wallet across categories, and they shop more frequently. That's because once they've gone through the process of opening a credit account, it's more convenient for them to shop with us, and of course, they already have the reassurance of knowing that they have access to that credit. We've been building our finance base, which currently stands at just over half a million active customers, and they have about three quarters of a billion pounds available to spend on their accounts. We now also have a growing AO membership, and that base pay 39 pounds a year for the benefit of free delivery, free recycling, and great member deals. Those members are already demonstrating a willingness to give us a greater share of their wallet, giving us a clear right to win with them across new categories. Similarly, in our insurance business, we now have over a million customers paying us a monthly direct debit and trusting us for their peace of mind. Members, with both finance accounts and insurance, give us an even greater share of their wallet. In our mobile business, we now have over 1.1 million active customers. And members who have finance accounts, insurance products, and a mobile phone, well, guess what? They give us an even greater share of their wallet. So I'm sure you can see where I'm going with it. The further that we deepen our relationship with customers at scale, the greater our right to win a bigger share of their wallet, and so the more our unit economics improve. In turn, this enables us to keep investing in the reasons for customers to share that wallet with us. All the data that sits behind this is clearly extremely commercially sensitive. So today, I'm really just outlining the principles of the flywheel that drives what we think of as our shared economics model. And this enables us to share those unit economics with customers and to share value creation with investors. It also allows us to deepen our relationships with suppliers through a greater ability to directionally sell products to our members, plus, from a people perspective, playing for a winning team is just a lot more fun than battling relegation, which is hugely rewarding for all AOs who thrive in that high performance fast paced culture. And ultimately, it's the data that we can see building behind all that and the compounding effect of the customer cohorts that underpins our confidence in the ambition of double digit growth. And as Mark alluded to, we also believe there's possibly a medium term tailwind on the horizon as well, because of the amount of volume that was pulled forward into the COVID lockdown period. For context, MDA volumes were 16.2 million units in 2020, 15.4 million units in 21, compared to only 12.9 million units in 2023. Now, our planning assumes that we stick with today's historically low volumes and that they will continue in the short term. But we are now four years from the start of the COVID spike. And even with slightly longer purchase cycles of electricals, it does seem reasonable to assume that there will be some growth returning to the replacement cycles from those COVID peaks four years ago in the not too distant future. As ever, none of this is going to be absolute plain sailing or a perfectly smooth journey, and our desire to keep driving at AO speed and keep innovating will create oscillations on the trajectory of our growth. But equally, the long term trend will be upwards, just as it has been for the last 24 years. And building these cohorts will take time. It requires lots of lessons and learnings, and it'll also occasionally need investment at times, I'm sure. There will also need to be occasional leaps of faith and an unwavering commitment to the cause. But I am more convinced than ever that this is the best strategy to create value for everyone from shareholders and customers to our people. And amidst all the talk of strategy, I don't want anyone to take for granted the brilliant retail basics that are so crucial to our business and will continue to underpin our success. And that's why we continue and always will obsess about them every day be that range, price, delivery, speed of delivery, availability, delivery execution, delivery with a smile, installation, and always been there for customers with a human touch. That obsession recently manifested itself in us passing the half a million trust pilot reviews milestone with a trust score of 4.8 out of five, meaning that AO is now the biggest scale trust pilot retailer in the UK with the highest quality rating. That's a really proud moment. And frankly, it's the scorecard of just thousands and thousands of hours of great customer service lessons. And all this forms the foundation for that very simple message that we are, as you all well know, the UK's most trusted electrical retailer. We have a firm conviction that the need for those brilliant retail basics is not going to change any time soon. And that means that we can really continue to invest in them with confidence. Plus, as I've said many times before, the reality is that the best service is actually no service. It should all just work, and it's also the most profitable service because every intervention costs money, and you've seen that in the results today. And all of this, in turn, gives us a clear structural advantage over time through the trust that it will generate with customers and other stakeholders. And so with that, I'll finish where I started by reiterating our confidence, which I hope some of you will now be more inclined to share a little of. The AO will be back to double digit growth every year for the next five years. And with our medium term PBT target in excess of 5%, and having all that manifest into what I think of as just good old fashioned cash. So thank you for everyone's time today. Thank you for coming along. And before we move to Q&amp;A, as a point of housekeeping, we've got a microphone. So if you can take the microphone and before asking a question, if you can just state your name and organization so that anyone watching can hear. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Hi, there Ben Hunt from invested. You talk about the need to improve unit economics. And it feels like more of a growth to achieve these medium term objections it's got to come from the non-MDA categories. Historically, there's obviously been your warehousing configuration is set up for MDA. Can you perhaps talk about any plans or progress you're making improving perhaps those unit economics? &gt;&gt; Quite simply, we've fixed all the unit economics. You're dead right. All our operations in our heritage of MDA are built to move big stuff around with two man home delivery, and you need a completely different operation with much more automation for smaller boxes. And so what we've done through the year is we've in simple terms, moved all of that small stuff out of our two man operation, and we've partnered with a business called DCC leverage in their capital investment. There's no capital investment for us. And we put our volume through that. And it's been a careful journey to make sure that we do that and we tie all that together from a tech and a customer proposition point of view, as well as fixing the unit economics. And again, there's more stages of that to come through the year. But the growth that we will see in those newer categories through repeat business will drive us towards our 5% PBT target. So the economic element of that is done. &gt;&gt; And in a second, can you just talk a little bit more about the mobile market? The second half looked quite poor. You allude to the connections being down. And maybe context to the two new mobile sites that you've acquired and how that relationship is going to improve with the mobile network operators and your volume commitments. &gt;&gt; So in simple terms, we were clear when we set out our update at the end of last year. The key part of our pivot to profit strategy was that if we could not see business units with a line of sight to profitability and cash generation, we'd come out of it. And we've got lots of examples, Germany being the biggest one, but our partnership with Tesco was another one. House Builders was another one. And a mobile was another one on the list. I was really clear. The new contract market on mobile has got an enormous amount of dysfunctionality and bad behavior that's built into it. That's not a business that we wanted. This will be the last year of pain for our mobile business. We're building different agreements now in partnership with the networks where we win together or we lose together. And obviously, as Mark mentioned we opportunistically wasn't in our plan to buy one A1 as was one of our biggest competitors in that market through the period as well. So it won't be a case of putting those two businesses together and it being the combined entity. It'll be smaller than the combined entity, but it'll be a much better business for us, and it should generate cash, and it should contribute profit. &gt;&gt; Good morning, Caroline Gulliver from Equity Development. My first question was around operating leverage. You mentioned that obviously there's minimum wage increases, putting a bit of solid cost inflation still in this year. But as we look forward and you're generating double digit revenue growth, what are some of the levers or what might you like to invest in and how much should we expect might fall to profitability in getting towards that 5% PBT margin? &gt;&gt; Well, at its most simple level, we're guiding our journey towards 5% PBT. We'll have lots of choices then of how we think about that. If you look at a very macro level, I don't know the exact numbers, but it's about 11% of our sales go to pay central overhead. That central overhead is extremely well invested and doesn't rise in line with sales. Mark and I are quite expensive. We don't need another me. We don't need another Mark. so we will be leveraging a lot of that central overhead as we go through. But naturally, we'll have improved unit economics through leverage of central warehousing and things like that. So it's across the piece. We will continue to obsess about efficiencies. I've always said even through the pivot to profit, you never cut your way to success. So this was about repositioning the business. We've done that. We are back to growth. We are confident we can see all the things that are going to drive growth. But it's not as though we're going to go and spend, let's go and spend 10 million on TV to drive the growth. This is about much more, I've used the phrase many times of reassuringly boring. When we've got these building these cohorts in a high value ticket environment with low frequency of purchase is expensive and takes time. And the point that we're highlighting is, we put 600,000 new customers into our business this year. At the level of service that we're providing, there's seeds for next year's sales, there's seeds for this year's sales. And as we improve things like the awareness of the other categories that we're selling, and as we get more members, as we get more finance accounts, that engine and that flywheel just drives. There's no silver bullet in this. This is now moving through the phases of growth, and it is broadly playing out exactly as we thought it would, and that drives our economic model. But the important thing is, for me, that we don't expect all that to flow to the bottom line because we're operating a shared economics model. So customers are paying 39 pounds for free delivery free recycling and member pricing. The more profitable we can make the business, the more we can invest in that flywheel to give them better value for their 39 pounds as well. And we can do that across lots of different metrics with lots of different levers. And that's why I don't want to really go into the micro detail of that, because there are so many choices for us to make. The key is for people to focus on us being back to being a double digit growth business on a journey to 5% PBT. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; And then we made it to roughly 70%-80% [inaudible 00:25:30]. &gt;&gt; We're going to make our business balance sheet bulletproof. That's priority 1. And 2022 was a difficult year for us. We're never going to go there again. So absolute bulletproof, and then we'll think about it thereafter. In my category as high class problems, and we'll deal with it when we get to it. &gt;&gt; Good morning, guys. What do you talk a bit about where we are on the journey in terms of increasing that range and small domestic prices and [inaudible 00:26:10] category. And I suppose as well, just how you're thinking about maintaining that customer experience that trust you move out with someone else take responsibility filment. I guess that delivery is been a big part of differentiate. &gt;&gt; Yeah, so there's no massive change in that. So we primarily partner with DPD around delivery. But we have done even when those products were coming out of our two man warehouse, most of it still went on a DPD vehicle. Their service is very good. We've got everything in the background to deal with that. If it's not, we fall back on. We've got amazing people in our customer service team, and our obsession with customer service make sure that those customers get looked after. And so that DPD service has been in place for years, and so there won't be any outward change on that. In terms of where are we on the journey? I'd probably score as 3-4 out of 10, but as material progress, because we were probably more like one-and-a-half to two. And so we will bring more of that range into our own stock holding, we'll take more of the risk of stock. We'll build more credibility in those categories. We're already seeing that. We'll deepen our relationships with the brands and the manufacturers of the products. And as the awareness within our existing customer base grows, then logically, we're already seeing our market shares in those newer categories, materially over index with existing and repeat customers than it does with new customers. So it's just a journey. And again, it isn't a light switch. It's just a progression. But to be clear, we're only 15% share in MDA. It's not the end of our MDA growth journey. So those 600,000 new customers this year, I expect them to buy MDA from us as well. &gt;&gt; And is that better reason to expect, we should see stock in terms of stock holding trend up a bit as you move into those small domestic categories for the more scale. &gt;&gt; I think that should make sense. Nothing of any great materiality to be concerned about. In the same way that we've had supply chain disruption. Everybody is pretty well reported around the disruption that's happened. Stuff that comes from the Far East is now taking longer. So our priority is to maintain the proposition and protect customers from any impact of that. So we have increased our stock holding in certain areas because of that as well. So it's a great investment. Stock is a wonderful investment for us. We have relatively microscopic obsolescence within that stock. So it genuinely is a great investment for us. &gt;&gt; And from a work of capital, point of view, you'll see an offset in trade creditors. So if there is an increase in stock, the offset credit. There's no investment. &gt;&gt; Are there any wave from Jeffreys. Following on the non-MDA theme. You should talked about that category, helping drive towards 5% PBT margin. You talked about it being fixed from economic perspective. Does that mean that this year, as in now, the economics are where they're going to get to or is there still a journey on gross margin, which you're going to be going through over time as you scale as the first one? &gt;&gt; I mean, so yes, we fixed the delivery element and the warehousing element of it. I think there is still a progression to go with the manufacturers of those products that will develop over time. So I think there's more opportunity to go, but the Day 1, do we not lose money on this stuff anymore? That's the more to make? Yes, there is. &gt;&gt; And I think just build on that, the very manual way of warehousing and moving those products around has been removed, and we've got all the benefits of all the automation in effect without the CapX operation. &gt;&gt; Okay, thanks. That's clear. Second one on that, from a customer-facing perspective on the non-MDA, what is going to look different? Is the range going to be bigger? Is it going to be a bit more obvious and a bit more as input in, but promotion as in visibility, perhaps on the website, and is probably going to be a bit sharper? I don't know. &gt;&gt; Everything. So I mean, it literally is everything. So from a proposition perspective, the ultimate goal is next-day delivery every day, seven days a week for up til midnight. So how you get to that? So pushing back that time window so customers can shop longer for next-day delivery, increasing the range. Improving the web journey as well. Our website, it has some fundamental flaws in it because it was built for MDA. So if you want to download software in our system, it has to have a color. So you download white software. And so in the background, we're paying some of this Mark talked about on the system debt, of paying some of that down so that we can present those products specific by category. We're here at Hatton Garden, which is at the heart of our creative hub of how we create content for customers to be able to shop products better. And so we're getting ever better at how we tell those product stories with different complications. Shopping consumer electronics is just a mind field for the average consumer. And so what we are historically very good at is taking that customer journey and making that customer journey much better. So it really is across everything. And then, of course, price. We want a price reason for customers to shop with us. And those customers that are investing with us in being members, they're enabling us to invest back in their shared economics model. &gt;&gt; Okay. Thanks. And then last one on the other admin element of your cost base is about 11%, I think now. You talk about it being substantially fixed from here on in. Where can that get down to in time? &gt;&gt; Or is that entirely dependent on where top line gets to? &gt;&gt; Yeah then that's the answer, is that the cash amount is pre-fixed, or it's going to go up with inflation, but it is a pre-fixed and well-invested number. And so the question is where's the top line going in [inaudible 00:33:10]? &gt;&gt; Fine. All right. Thanks. &gt;&gt; Importantly though Andy, what we choose to do with that in the shared economics model. If we drive another four or 5% of saving out of that central overhead over time, that doesn't necessarily mean we're going to choose to, as Jeff Bezos used to say, your margin is my opportunity. We really want to drive that volume-shared economics model and choose where to reinvest those operational savings that we create. &gt;&gt; Sounding more like a Costco model. &gt;&gt; Say again. &gt;&gt; Sounding more like a Costco model. &gt;&gt; Funny that. Okay. Any other questions? All right. Great. Well, it's great to be back to growth and to be delivering fantastic results today. Record ever profit, and thanks for being here to listen to it. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thanks.",2024-06-27,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240627:nRTVbYw49F:6,Tesco,social

"The UK's biggest supermarket chain, Tesco, faced criticism over its chief executive's near- £10m pay deal at its annual shareholder meeting on Friday.The campaign groups ShareAction and the High Pay Centre both questioned why Ken Murphy's pay had more than doubled to £9.9m including bonuses, when some of those working in its supermarkets do not receive the real living wage.""Can the board explain why it is comfortable with chief executive pay doubling last year to 430 times [that of the] average employee and not comfortable with providing third-party contracted workers such as cleaners and security guards with the real living wage,"" Peter, a Share Action activist, asked at the meeting.A member of the High Pay Centre said Murphy's pay in relation to ordinary workers was ""one of the most extreme pay ratios in the FTSE 100"".Although the majority of store workers get the independently verified living wage – which is higher than the legal minimum – ShareAction claims contracted staff, such as cleaners and security, do not.Murphy said on Friday: ""I accept I am well paid. My remuneration is set by the board as delegated by shareholders. Over two-thirds of it is variable and dependent on reaching long-term financial goals.""He added that Tesco had made ""record investments"" in pay for ordinary workers over the past two years. He said he was ""really proud of [the] fact we are a leading employer in terms of our total package for colleagues"" and that Tesco was ""not unduly worried"" by Labour's plans for improved workers' rights as it already had in place many of the measures expected to be implemented if the party wins power.Gerry Murphy, Tesco's chairman, later told the annual shareholder meeting that the company was recruiting in a global market for executives and ""the fact is we have to be competitive"".However, Dan Howard, the head of good work at ShareAction, said: ""In a world where Tesco are making a £2.3bn profit a year, paying those who keep the stores safe and clean the real living wage shouldn't have to be asked for – it should be automatic.""Unfortunately, Tesco are dragging their feet on taking the right steps to pay its third-party contracted staff the living wage.""Failing to recognise the financial hardship many of those who work for Tesco have faced during the cost of living crisis will damage Tesco's reputation with both shareholders and customers.""On Friday, Tesco, which owns the Booker wholesaler and supermarkets in Ireland and mainland Europe as well as UK supermarkets and convenience stores, said it continued to win over shoppers from its rivals with sales up 5.3% at its UK chain and 4.5% overall.Murphy said inflation was continuing to ease and was now less than 3%. He added that he expected it to remain at that level for the remainder of the year despite a rise in shipping costs, linked to problems in the Red Sea, and poor weather in the UK and Europe, which is affecting crops.He said the British strawberry season had been delayed and the asparagus season had been shorter than hoped but there were no shortages as Tesco had made ""alternative arrangements"".Murphy added there was a ""gentle ongoing improvement in customer sentiment"" in the UK helped by a rise in the legal minimum wage that was ahead of inflation.However, he admitted that sales of nonfood items were weaker than food as the wet and cold weather continued to affect demand for summer clothing, barbecue kit and other seasonal items.Copyright (c) 2024 theguardian.com-NonSyndicated",2024-06-14,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240614:nNRAsyvlbz:21,Tesco,governance

"Tesco has been accused of giving struggling workers a ""slap in the face"" after the UK supermarket's boss earned almost £10m last year as profits soared during the cost of living crisis.Ken Murphy was given £9.9m in pay and perks, more than double the previous year and thought to be the most ever for a Tesco boss, beating £7m-plus paydays for the former chief executive Sir Terry Leahy.More than half of Murphy's payout relates to a long-term bonus worth three times his basic salary paid in shares that must be held for at least two years. A further £3.4m annual bonus is linked to sales, profits and individual objectives, according to Tesco's annual shareholder report, which was published on Tuesday.The increase in total pay means that Murphy now earns more than 430 times the average pay at Tesco, up from a multiple of 197 in the previous year. He is one of the best-paid executives among the leading FTSE 100-listed companies, although still well behind the £18.7m that the best paid – the AstraZeneca boss Pascal Soriot – could earn this year.Tesco, which owns the Booker grocery wholesaler and runs stores in eastern Europe and the Republic of Ireland as well as the UK, last month revealed pre-tax profits had soared by 159% to £2.3bn – the highest in more than a decade – in the year to 24 February. Sales rose 7.4% to almost £61.5bn, led by strong expansion online and in large stores.Sharon Graham, the general secretary of the Unite union, said: ""Ken Murphy's £5m wage increase is a slap in the face to the millions of struggling workers and their families who paid for it through higher food bills. The fact is, Tesco has taken advantage of the cost of living crisis to rake in obscene profits, and it is far from the only one.""Luke Hildyard, the executive director of the High Pay Centre thinktank, added that Murphy's pay gap with a typical employee was the third highest since pay ratio reporting began five years ago.He said: ""You couldn't really get a better indicator of how the UK economy serves the interests of the super-rich at the expense of everybody else than this – a multimillionaire chief executive trousering another £10m while their customers endure major price rises and their employees have to get by on less than a quarter of a per cent of what the CEO takes home.""Murphy missed out on 5% of his potential annual bonus, or £176,000, after Tesco missed targets on cutting food waste, while his fixed pay slipped to £1.6m from £1.7m a year before, after the company stopped subsidising his commuting.Alison Platt, the chair of Tesco's remuneration committee, said Murphy's pay was benchmarked against pay for other FTSE 50 companies and other comparable international businesses. ""This pay award reflects the fact Tesco has delivered for all of its stakeholders over the last year – from its most competitive-ever customer offer to its record investment in colleague pay.""A large proportion of the total package has been achieved because the business met stretching targets in a highly competitive sector and worked to create value for customers, colleagues, suppliers, communities and shareholders.""This year, Murphy's basic salary rises 3% to £1.46m from £1.41m, so he could earn more than £9m again. The figures have emerged after Tesco was condemned by some staff as a month-long delay to a promised pay rise at the supermarket left them on less than the minimum wage, while saving the supermarket more than £17m.About 220,000 staff shared a £70m ""thank you"" payment after the rise in profits, equivalent to 1.5% of annual pay, with a full-time shop worker expected to receive about £300.The report also shows long-term share bonus payouts for the former boss of Tesco Dave Lewis and the former finance director Alan Stewart, who received shares worth almost £1.6m and £1.7m respectively in the past year based on performance while they were in the business.Copyright (c) 2024 theguardian.com-NonSyndicated",2024-05-14,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240514:nNRAsnt1xe:35,Tesco,governance
"Tesco boss Ken Murphy has seen his pay deal more than double, up to almost £10 million for the past year.It means the chief executive has been paid 431 times the wage of the average Tesco worker at £23,010.The supermarket giant's annual report revealed Mr Murphy received a pay package worth £9.93 million for the year to February.It compared with a £4.44 million total pay deal for the previous financial year.Mr Murphy's latest deal was driven by £4.91 million from his performance share plan (PSP) after helping led the company to higher profits in the face of a challenging inflation backdrop.This PSP payment will be paid out in Tesco shares and is based on the company's performance since 2021.It comes on top of an annual salary of £1.64 million and annual bonus of £3.38 million.Meanwhile, the group's chief finance officer, Imran Nawaz, also saw his annual pay package more than double.He received a total pay deal of £4.95 million for the year, jumping from £2.27 million in the previous financial year.It came after Tesco last month posted an adjusted operating profit of £2.83 billion for the year to February, up almost 13% on the previous year.However, the retailer came under criticism at the time for revealing the bumper profits when many customers had been impacted by rampant food and drink inflation, which soared in the face of supply chain disruption and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Alison Platt, chairwoman of the Tesco remuneration committee, said: ""This pay award reflects the fact Tesco has delivered for all of its stakeholders over the last year – from its most competitive-ever customer offer, to its record investment in colleague pay.""It also recognises the strong performance of the business while at the same time reflecting the complexities of managing a business of the size and scale of Tesco.""A large proportion of the total package has been achieved because the business met stretching targets in a highly competitive sector and worked to create value for customers, colleagues, suppliers, communities and shareholders.""Tesco remains committed to a competitive and fair reward package for all colleagues and over the last two years we have invested more than £800 million in colleague pay, as well as significantly enhancing the range of wellbeing benefits we offer.""Copyright (c) 2024 Independent.co.uk",2024-05-14,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240514:nNRAsnq0av:7,Tesco,governance

""Why am I treated like a criminal?"" she asked at the time.She says the manager offered her and her children a bunch of bananas as a ""goodwill gesture"". She then took out her phone, started filming the exchange and asked why she was offered bananas, adding that it was offensive because ""Black people are constantly called monkeys"".Tesco replied offering an apology in an email seen by The Independent, while neglecting to offer an explanation for its staff members' behaviour.""We sincerely apologise for your experience at our store.

Tesco Ireland, the Republic of Ireland-based subsidiary of British supermarket giant Tesco, has revealed plans to use a new, more sustainable packaging format for its range of fresh mince meat products.The plans follow a successful trial period last year.As part of the trial, the retailer used the new packaging, known as a 'pillow pack', on its 470g packs of Tesco Irish lean steak mince.The pillow pack replaces the traditional plastic tray and film lid, resulting in a significant reduction in plastic usage.Based on the trial's success, Tesco has decided to expand the use of the pillow pack across its beef, lamb, and pork mince meats, encompassing more than 14 products in the range.The new packaging uses just under 70% less plastic while maintaining a high-quality appearance, taste, and texture.The pillow pack, a type of flow wrap packaging, differs from vacuum packs by keeping the mince in an inflated 'pillow' that prevents compression, ensuring the meat remains in perfect condition.Tesco Ireland fresh food category director John Brennan said: ""Pillow pack packaging uses 68% less plastic and guarantees the same high-quality appearance, and importantly, taste.""Customers have grown used to these packs over recent months and can now expect to see this packaging on all mince products across our 175 stores. The plastic reduction element is significant and has the potential to save 76 tonnes of plastic each year."" Tesco Ireland said it is encouraging customers to recycle the packaging by returning it to the store's front-of-store recycling units along with other soft plastics.This latest packaging innovation underscores Tesco's ongoing efforts to minimise packaging waste.Tesco Ireland sustainability head Andy McGregor said: ""Where we need packaging, because it serves a clear purpose like reducing food waste or to protect a product in transit, we do our best to ensure that what we do use is from sustainable sources and where possible, goes on to be reused or recycled.""We are committed to reducing all unnecessary packaging, and by 2025 our packaging will be fully recyclable, and all paper and board used will be 100% sustainable.""Earlier this year, Tesco launched tubeless kitchen foil in the UK, a move that is expected to eliminate the need for 12.5 million cardboard rolls each year. Copyright © 2024 MarketLine",2024-05-03,urn:newsml:newswire.refinitiv.com:20240503:nNRAsk16sr:1,Tesco,sustainability
