It is controlled by China. Smelting is an environmentally harmful\nprocess worse than C02 that can cause environmental damage (water, air).\nTailings from sulphide minerals in mining waste have the potential to\ncreate acid. China Controls 68-80% of nickel refining smelting, and\ncontrols 84% of the Indonesia Nickel Market. A report from the Brookings\nInstitute said that: Even if the U.S. and EU were to dig more minerals out\nof the ground, many of these minerals would need to be shipped overseas for\nconcentrating, refining, and smelting without significant increases in U.S.\nand European mineral refining and smelting capacity. The U.S., in\nparticular, will likely have to update and amend its mining regulatory\nregime. Governments will also have to onshore or friend-shore smelting and\nrefining capacity. The midstream part of the equation is likely to be the\nmost challenging, complicated by high investment costs and market\nconditions. Active Companies mentioned in the article include: First\nAtlantic Nickel Corp. (OTCQB: FANCF) (TSX-V: FAN), Alaska Energy Metals\nCorporation (TSX-V: AEMC) (OTCQB: AKEMF), Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F),\nGeneral Motors Co. (NYSE: GM), TMC the metals company Inc. (NASDAQ: TMC).\n\n     The U.S. Government (USGS) sees a better way saying: The development\nof awaruite deposits in other parts of Canada may help alleviate any\nprolonged shortage of nickel concentrate. Awaruite, a natural iron-nickel\nalloy, is much easier to concentrate than pentlandite, the principal\nsulfide of nickel. Awaruite is safer and more economical to process due to\nthe magnetic separation and concentration. It uses less chemicals, less\nenergy, can be processed directly in North America and since no smelting is\nrequired doesnt need to go to China. Awaruite means no burning, which\nreleases sulfur dioxide and other toxic emissions, and less risk of acid\nmine tailings accidents or contaminations (no sulphide minerals present).\n\n     A report from Science Direct said: Nickel is an important component of\nstainless steel and a wide range of applications which are critical for the\ntransition to clean energies including electric vehicle batteries. Awaruite\nis a native nickeliron alloy that has gained interest as a possible new\neconomic source of nickel. In the last decades, there have been discoveries\nof awaruite, mostly with more significant amounts of nickel sulphides, that\nhave demonstrated the potential for awaruite to contribute to the economics\nof a deposit. This study is focused on the very large Baptiste deposit in\ncentral British Columbia, Canada where awaruite is the primary nickel\nmineral. It concluded: Awaruite has the potential to be concentrated in a\nunique and valuable nickel concentrate of distinctive characteristics\nincluding its very high nickel content, which lowers both the downstream\ncosts and the carbon intensity. Furthermore, the negligible content of\nsulphur and penalty trace elements, such as mercury, antimony, and arsenic\nin a potential awaruite concentrate, minimizes the costs of refining it.\n\n     First Atlantic Nickel Corp. (OTCQB: FANCF) (TSX-V: FAN) Hosts\nStrategic Investor Site Visit, Expands Geological Team, and Reports\nMilestones on Infrastructure Upgrades at Atlantic Nickel Project - First\nAtlantic Nickel Corp. (FSE: P21) (\"First Atlantic\" or the \"Company\") is\npleased to provide an update on the progress at its wholly-owned Atlantic\nNickel Project in central Newfoundland, Canada (the \"Project\" or the\n\"Atlantic Nickel Project\"). The Company recently completed the first site\nvisit with a strategic corporate investor (the \"Strategic Investor\"), which\nincluded examining nickel-bearing occurrences and historical drill core.\nFirst Atlantic welcomes the Strategic Investor's support, knowledge, and\nexperience in mining project exploration and development.\n\n     Highlights:\n\n//st\n\n  * First site visit at Atlantic Nickel Project with Corporate Strategic\nInvestor completed.\n  * Awaruite identified as visible grains in previous drill core from\nAtlantic Lake Area.\n  * First bridge installed as part of road upgrade and development program,\nenabling year-round Project access.\n  * Technical Advisor, Dr. Ron Britten has conducted a site visit to\nexamine awaruite nickel occurrences and will help lead the charge to\ndiscover a potential large scale deposit.\n  * Permits filed for phase 2 of new all-weather road construction.\n  * Geological team with awaruite experience expanded to accelerate\ndistrict-scale exploration efforts along extensive 30 km trend.\n\n//et\n\n     Project Road Update: First Atlantic is also pleased to announce the\ninstallation of the first bridge as part of its infrastructure upgrade\nprogram on the Project. The Company anticipates the completion of two\nadditional bridges, allowing for the establishment of operations directly\non the Project site, enhancing future operational efficiency.\n\n     The installation of the first bridge marks a significant milestone in\nconducting large-scale district-size mining exploration operations. The\nroad will provide faster and closer access to additional awaruite zones\nthroughout the district, allowing for year-round exploration work and\ndrilling. Improved road access reduces the cost per meter of drilling,\nenabling significantly more drilling activities.\n\n     Exploration Updates: Preparations are underway for the Exploration\nCamp with a permit in place. The camp will serve as a strategic base for\non-site operations, enabling the exploration team to work efficiently in\nthe field. To ensure year-round access to the site, road upgrades are being\nimplemented, allowing for easy ground access regardless of the season.\n\n     The exploration program is focusing on grading and prioritizing\nawaruite outcrops, as well as sampling and mapping prospective drill\ntargets along the 30km trend. A LiDAR/Photos airborne program is also being\nplanned to aid in this work, providing high-resolution topographic data and\naerial imagery. The LiDAR data will help identify key geological\nstructures, while the aerial photos will be used to visually identify\noutcrops for the geological team to investigate on the ground. This\nintegrated approach will further support exploration and development\nefforts.\n\n     Technical Advisor, Dr. Ron Britten, has completed an initial site\nvisit and is working closely with the First Atlantic exploration team\non-site. With his decades of experience, including discovering the Baptiste\nawaruite deposit containing over 10 billion pounds of nickel, Dr. Britten\nwill enhance the program. Dr. Britten's efforts will help outline the best\noccurrences for targeting in the initial drill program planned for this\nyear. This large-scale district sampling program can continue during the\nroad construction phase necessary for full drilling operations.

It is controlled by China. Smelting is an environmentally harmful process worse than C02 that can cause environmental damage (water, air). Tailings from sulphide minerals in mining waste have the potential to create acid. China Controls 68-80% of nickel refining smelting, and controls 84% of the Indonesia Nickel Market. A <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=_b5o5QdJ372S233bP04Ox7cWj9E3_ZKAp1wDy9FmZGc7MuU2wTxFv7RvXWrGWQJZviwE8bfEUOexMHYZyVBC9Lu56nL6-vwXmnXDoXj99MCIbigTk-xf-Z-JiFyKmgVMYVMuVfE7uGOJ-ZhautpPgg==\"><u>report</u></a> from the Brookings Institute said that: “Even if the U.S. and EU were to dig more minerals out of the ground, many of these minerals would need to be shipped overseas for concentrating, refining, and smelting without significant increases in U.S. and European mineral refining and smelting capacity. <span>The U.S., in particular, will likely have to update and amend its mining regulatory regime. Governments will also have to onshore or “friend-shore” smelting and refining capacity. The midstream part of the equation is likely to be the most challenging, complicated by high investment costs and market conditions.” </span>Active Companies mentioned in the article include: <strong>First Atlantic Nickel Corp. </strong>(OTCQB: FANCF) (TSX-V: FAN), <strong>Alaska Energy Metals Corporation </strong>(TSX-V: AEMC) (OTCQB: AKEMF), <strong>Ford Motor Company </strong>(NYSE: F),<strong> General Motors Co. </strong>(NYSE: GM),<strong> TMC the metals company Inc. </strong>(NASDAQ: TMC).<br/></p><p>The U.S. Government (USGS) sees a <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3S3INtcIOHZPk1VFB8GAvWba3XRkjGaO6qs2CvsfybNMdpkuVbhawYJl_AHHz90MXaZ4pozQHgzJvH-UGfn7ndEjRaQ8CMMuJFIxmCXZs3kka148BkRrCuxGbe3C5WdieG3xWNZHudcc1hybKcJqxFK_oD3WJpXqg9enmg5V3R1W1gaem7PxOPZtyyWlBb0h\"><u>better way</u></a> saying: “The development of awaruite deposits in other parts of Canada may help alleviate any prolonged shortage of nickel concentrate. <strong>Awaruite, a natural iron-nickel alloy, is much easier to concentrate</strong> than pentlandite, the principal sulfide of nickel. Awaruite is safer and more economical to process due to the magnetic separation and concentration. It uses less chemicals, less energy, can be processed directly in North America and since no smelting is required doesn’t need to go to China. Awaruite means no burning, which releases sulfur dioxide and other toxic emissions, and less risk of acid mine tailings accidents or contaminations (no sulphide minerals present).”</p><p>A report from Science Direct said: “Nickel is an important component of stainless steel and a wide range of applications which are critical for the transition to clean energies including electric vehicle batteries. Awaruite is a native nickel–iron alloy that has gained interest as a possible new economic source of nickel. In the last decades, there have been discoveries of awaruite, mostly with more significant amounts of nickel sulphides, that have demonstrated the potential for awaruite to contribute to the economics of a deposit. This study is focused on the very large Baptiste deposit in central British Columbia, Canada where awaruite is the primary nickel mineral.” It concluded: “Awaruite has the potential to be concentrated in a unique and valuable nickel concentrate of distinctive characteristics including its very high nickel content, which lowers both the downstream costs and the carbon intensity. Furthermore, the negligible content of sulphur and penalty trace elements, such as mercury, antimony, and arsenic in a potential awaruite concentrate, minimizes the costs of refining it.”</p><p><strong>First Atlantic Nickel Corp. (OTCQB: FANCF) (TSX-V: FAN) Hosts Strategic Investor Site Visit, Expands Geological Team, and Reports Milestones on Infrastructure Upgrades at Atlantic Nickel Project - </strong>First Atlantic Nickel Corp. (FSE: P21) (\"First Atlantic\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to provide an update on the progress at its wholly-owned Atlantic Nickel Project in central Newfoundland, Canada (the \"Project\" or the \"Atlantic Nickel Project\"). The Company recently completed the first site visit with a strategic corporate investor (the \"Strategic Investor\"), which included examining nickel-bearing occurrences and historical drill core. First Atlantic welcomes the Strategic Investor's support, knowledge, and experience in mining project exploration and development.</p><p>Highlights:</p><ul type=\"disc\" class=\"bulleted-list arrowlist\"><li>First site visit at Atlantic Nickel Project with Corporate Strategic Investor completed.</li><li>Awaruite identified as visible grains in previous drill core from Atlantic Lake Area.</li><li>First bridge installed as part of road upgrade and development program, enabling year-round Project access.</li><li>Technical Advisor, Dr. Ron Britten has conducted a site visit to examine awaruite nickel occurrences and will help lead the charge to discover a potential large scale deposit.</li><li>Permits filed for phase 2 of new all-weather road construction.</li><li>Geological team with awaruite experience expanded to accelerate district-scale exploration efforts along extensive 30 km trend.</li></ul><p><strong>Project Road Update: </strong>First Atlantic is also pleased to announce the installation of the first bridge as part of its infrastructure upgrade program on the Project. The Company anticipates the completion of two additional bridges, allowing for the establishment of operations directly on the Project site, enhancing future operational efficiency.</p><p>The installation of the first bridge marks a significant milestone in conducting large-scale district-size mining exploration operations. The road will provide faster and closer access to additional awaruite zones throughout the district, allowing for year-round exploration work and drilling. Improved road access reduces the cost per meter of drilling, enabling significantly more drilling activities.</p><p><strong>Exploration Updates: </strong>Preparations are underway for the Exploration Camp with a permit in place. The camp will serve as a strategic base for on-site operations, enabling the exploration team to work efficiently in the field. To ensure year-round access to the site, road upgrades are being implemented, allowing for easy ground access regardless of the season.</p><p>The exploration program is focusing on grading and prioritizing awaruite outcrops, as well as sampling and mapping prospective drill targets along the 30km trend. A LiDAR/Photos airborne program is also being planned to aid in this work, providing high-resolution topographic data and aerial imagery. The LiDAR data will help identify key geological structures, while the aerial photos will be used to visually identify outcrops for the geological team to investigate on the ground. This integrated approach will further support exploration and development efforts.</p><p>Technical Advisor, Dr. Ron Britten, has completed an initial site visit and is working closely with the First Atlantic exploration team on-site. With his decades of experience, including discovering the Baptiste awaruite deposit containing over 10 billion pounds of nickel, Dr. Britten will enhance the program. Dr. Britten's efforts will help outline the best occurrences for targeting in the initial drill program planned for this year. This large-scale district sampling program can continue during the road construction phase necessary for full drilling operations. <strong><span>CONTINUED…</span></strong><strong>Read this and more news for First Atlantic Nickel</strong><strong>at:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=H7cGPgydFNmm0qaTYjTL_itpVZgrYQSuhu0uwfArjg5j9G8kHKtYDBJULU7a2rNMRQDuxInNuukBKeVpJ3PMHx2am0ni3_DstebpN8FdhXZhGEplFsfWruX2NhBxaXso\"><u>https://www.fanickel.com/archive</u></a></p><p><span>In other market news of interest:</span><br/></p><p><strong>Alaska Energy Metals Corporation (TSX-V: AEMC) (OTCQB: AKEMF)</strong> recently <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=9Iv-myBYHLKrTe6EPHq4RcAAoPg49ulzS1zT6NBPJzh3YYpHICOCGmTi36WHoNs16T-Hp_-V_KBe9gUYRGA8Brn0EaTZSP5RByNVHzk_d3bYEJC7PSD8fVjACGQ5EvWzppi9VZbsmZfviQvImQWc4c4Y4oidLs0SUZP7qKvCPlI=\"><u>announced</u></a> that it has begun a drilling program to test compelling geological – geophysical – geochemical targets at the Canwell block of claims that form part of its Nikolai Nickel Project in Alaska.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned <span>Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc.</span>, No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: <a href=\"https://pr.report/114f\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf</strong></a>.</p><p></p><div class=\"tr-image\"><div class=\"tr-image-components\"><img src=\"https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/3abe59e8-1440-4e52-94e2-0331ea5e8018/892538/image.png\" data-internal-src=\"https://rp.cp.dtc.reuint.com/Apps/NewsServices/images?apiKey=5ebc2e3a-46da-43d2-9c9f-8030fb911eb9&amp;type=base64Url&amp;id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWNjZXNzd2lyZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VsaWJyYXJ5LzNhYmU1OWU4LTE0NDAtNGU1Mi05NGUyLTAzMzFlYTVlODAxOC84OTI1MzgvaW1hZ2UucG5n&amp;key=0b6e77e9c4b74543513e340582bf77d1839112aa9b96106e0dd80469b8ff8e6a1ec05bd9bb8ad4b85436c24ed4c55f73505ef9221942a4e47aea0549330b0d4b\"/></div></div><p></p><p><strong>What is the Lawsuit About?</strong></p><p>The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.</p><p>These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.</p><p>On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"</p><p>This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/114g\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

Then, on February 12, 2024, Teradata announced that \"deal timing issues\" caused the company to miss its previously issued ARR guidance.

This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.</p><p>These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.</p><p>On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.</p><p>Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/114a\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

(\"UiPath\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:PATH) and certain of the Company's senior executives.</p><p><strong>If you suffered losses on your UiPath investment, you are encouraged to submit your information at</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/107a\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Investors have until August 19, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned <span>Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc.</span>, No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: <a href=\"https://pr.report/107b\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf</strong></a>.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"></p><div class=\"tr-image\"><div class=\"tr-image-components\"><img src=\"https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/48a667c9-526b-480c-8604-8fa80b651346/892101/image.png\" data-internal-src=\"https://rp.cp.dtc.reuint.com/Apps/NewsServices/images?apiKey=5ebc2e3a-46da-43d2-9c9f-8030fb911eb9&amp;type=base64Url&amp;id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWNjZXNzd2lyZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VsaWJyYXJ5LzQ4YTY2N2M5LTUyNmItNDgwYy04NjA0LThmYTgwYjY1MTM0Ni84OTIxMDEvaW1hZ2UucG5n&amp;key=c8d1eb51f1165474a736053c15a9c0c419950c0fac8a9978b4c3b869f0ce041bf218b1373b74b36cab19bb3d7a648a9c8dd53b7282bfb8127fa120f9ccf83067\"/></div></div><p></p><p><strong>What is the Lawsuit About?</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled.

The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned <span>John Baxter v.

This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.</p><p>These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.</p><p>On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.</p><p>Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/1076\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

As a result, it is alleged that the company overstated the health of its pipeline and revenue growth prospects.</p><p>Investors allegedly began to learn the truth on December 7, 2023, when Teradata revealed that certain large deals could be delayed. On this news, the price of Teradata stock declined by $2.89 per share, or 6%, to close at $43.40 per share on December 7, 2023. Then, on February 12, 2024, Teradata announced that \"deal timing issues\" caused the company to miss its previously issued ARR guidance. On this news, the price of Teradata stock declined by $10.57 per share, or 22%, to close at $38.22 per share on February 13, 2024.</p><p>BFA Law encourages investors who lost money on their Teradata investment to submit your information to find out about your rights.</p><p><strong>Submit your information here:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/zs8\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/teradata-corp-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in Teradata Corp. you may be eligible to lead the case on behalf of shareholders.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and \"re-baselin[e]\" its entire Defense business.</p><p>On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts.

For instance, the Company assured investors that \"[n]otwithstanding the additional volatility\" from \"acute short-term headwinds for the Defense sector, management maintains a highly positive view of its growth potential over a multi-year period.\"</p><p>On November 14, 2023, CAE stated that certain legacy contracts continued to be plagued by cost overruns. CAE revealed that, within the Defense segment, the Company planned to \"retir[e] legacy contracts, which have been most affected by inflationary pressures.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $0.85 per share, or nearly 4%, from $21.92 per share on November 13, 2023, to $21.07 per share on November 14, 2023.</p><p>Three months later, on February 14, 2024, CAE announced that it \"sought to further accelerate the retirement of outstanding program risks, mainly associated with certain legacy Defense contracts that we entered into pre-COVID and have been most impacted by economic headwinds.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $2.01 per share, or nearly 10%, from $20.92 per share on February 13, 2024, to $18.91 per share on February 14, 2024.</p><p>Finally, after the close of trading on May 21, 2024, CAE announced a \"re-baselining of its Defense business, Defense impairments, [and] accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts.\" The Company stated that \"CAE has recorded a $568.0 million non-cash impairment of Defense goodwill,\" \"$90.3 million in unfavorable Defense contract profit adjustments as a result of accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts,\" and a \"$35.7 million impairment of related technology and other non-financial assets which are principally related to the Legacy Contracts.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $1.03 per share, or more than 5%, from $19.83 per share on May 21, 2024, to $18.80 per share on May 22, 2024.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/zll\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/cae-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in CAE, Inc. you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

(\"UiPath\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:PATH) and certain of the Company's senior executives.</p><p><strong>If you suffered losses on your UiPath investment, you are encouraged to submit your information at</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/zsx\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Investors have until August 19, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned <span>Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc.</span>, No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: <a href=\"https://pr.report/zsy\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf</strong></a>.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"></p><div class=\"tr-image\"><div class=\"tr-image-components\"><img src=\"https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/eac766ca-dc56-409a-9c7e-ea5a08cea932/891887/image.png\" data-internal-src=\"https://rp.cp.dtc.reuint.com/Apps/NewsServices/images?apiKey=5ebc2e3a-46da-43d2-9c9f-8030fb911eb9&amp;type=base64Url&amp;id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWNjZXNzd2lyZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VsaWJyYXJ5L2VhYzc2NmNhLWRjNTYtNDA5YS05YzdlLWVhNWEwOGNlYTkzMi84OTE4ODcvaW1hZ2UucG5n&amp;key=0a036f594aa810cb02701923c169326d27ce7ad174ecdb5d0d3ae9f4159700a1b620d1bc6fef9315924903bac21abea563c960d00051698c3143bb42a7c1e8bf\"/></div></div><p></p><p><strong>What is the Lawsuit About?</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/zsz\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.</p><p>These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.</p><p>On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.</p><p>Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/zt5\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and \"re-baselin[e]\" its entire Defense business.</p><p>On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts. On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $4.32 per share, or more than 16%, from $25.80 per share on August 9, 2022, to $21.48 per share on August 10, 2022.</p><p>Defendants, however, continued to make false representations regarding the strength of the Defense segment. For instance, the Company assured investors that \"[n]otwithstanding the additional volatility\" from \"acute short-term headwinds for the Defense sector, management maintains a highly positive view of its growth potential over a multi-year period.\"</p><p>On November 14, 2023, CAE stated that certain legacy contracts continued to be plagued by cost overruns. CAE revealed that, within the Defense segment, the Company planned to \"retir[e] legacy contracts, which have been most affected by inflationary pressures.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $0.85 per share, or nearly 4%, from $21.92 per share on November 13, 2023, to $21.07 per share on November 14, 2023.</p><p>Three months later, on February 14, 2024, CAE announced that it \"sought to further accelerate the retirement of outstanding program risks, mainly associated with certain legacy Defense contracts that we entered into pre-COVID and have been most impacted by economic headwinds.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $2.01 per share, or nearly 10%, from $20.92 per share on February 13, 2024, to $18.91 per share on February 14, 2024.</p><p>Finally, after the close of trading on May 21, 2024, CAE announced a \"re-baselining of its Defense business, Defense impairments, [and] accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts.\" The Company stated that \"CAE has recorded a $568.0 million non-cash impairment of Defense goodwill,\" \"$90.3 million in unfavorable Defense contract profit adjustments as a result of accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts,\" and a \"$35.7 million impairment of related technology and other non-financial assets which are principally related to the Legacy Contracts.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $1.03 per share, or more than 5%, from $19.83 per share on May 21, 2024, to $18.80 per share on May 22, 2024.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/y2x\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/cae-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in CAE, Inc. you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.</p><p>As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\").</p><p>BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties. BFA intends to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of Globe Life stockholders and to ensure that the fiduciaries are held accountable for the Company's pervasive violations of the law.</p><p><strong>Click here if you are a long-term holder:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/y3m\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you are a current holder of Globe Life Inc. stock, you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

The complaint alleges that between February 13, 2023 and February 12, 2024, Teradata and certain of its senior executives made materially false and misleading statements related to: (a) the success of the company's recently expanded business model to market products to customers beyond their IT units; (b) the robustness of the company's pipeline and ability to timely close deals; and (c) the company's revenue growth prospects.</p><p>The complaint further alleges that, in reality, Teradata's expanded business model caused significant delays in the closing of large customer transactions. As a result, it is alleged that the company overstated the health of its pipeline and revenue growth prospects.</p><p>Investors allegedly began to learn the truth on December 7, 2023, when Teradata revealed that certain large deals could be delayed. On this news, the price of Teradata stock declined by $2.89 per share, or 6%, to close at $43.40 per share on December 7, 2023. Then, on February 12, 2024, Teradata announced that \"deal timing issues\" caused the company to miss its previously issued ARR guidance. On this news, the price of Teradata stock declined by $10.57 per share, or 22%, to close at $38.22 per share on February 13, 2024.</p><p>BFA Law encourages investors who lost money on their Teradata investment to submit your information to find out about your rights.</p><p><strong>Submit your information here:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/x24\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/teradata-corp-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in Teradata Corp. you may be eligible to lead the case on behalf of shareholders.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

(\"UiPath\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:PATH) and certain of the Company's senior executives.</p><p><strong>If you suffered losses on your UiPath investment, you are encouraged to submit your information at</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/x1m\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Investors have until August 19, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned <span>Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc.</span>, No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: <a href=\"https://pr.report/x1n\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf</strong></a>.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"></p><div class=\"tr-image\"><div class=\"tr-image-components\"><img src=\"https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/ba8abe03-bd1f-4298-a101-0e3c55da1fab/890621/image.png\" data-internal-src=\"https://rp.cp.dtc.reuint.com/Apps/NewsServices/images?apiKey=5ebc2e3a-46da-43d2-9c9f-8030fb911eb9&amp;type=base64Url&amp;id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWNjZXNzd2lyZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VsaWJyYXJ5L2JhOGFiZTAzLWJkMWYtNDI5OC1hMTAxLTBlM2M1NWRhMWZhYi84OTA2MjEvaW1hZ2UucG5n&amp;key=682ed0bcb2af8441417c85793d4796d8454b102d47b9b819e1613fa6c0da5c4d0a5f0aa8b2400fb336ccdd0adbcc0beb6e8a9640c806dae553ab2a5266ca17ec\"/></div></div><p></p><p><strong>What is the Lawsuit About?</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/x1o\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.</p><p>As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\").</p><p>BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties. BFA intends to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of Globe Life stockholders and to ensure that the fiduciaries are held accountable for the Company's pervasive violations of the law.</p><p><strong>Click here if you are a long-term holder:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/x15\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you are a current holder of Globe Life Inc. stock, you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned <span>John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al.</span>, No. 1:24-cv-05191.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong><div class=\"tr-image\"><div class=\"tr-image-components\"><img src=\"https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/4db8e1e6-0e97-4c9e-a135-3841d6dd3b9d/890502/image.png\" data-internal-src=\"https://rp.cp.dtc.reuint.com/Apps/NewsServices/images?apiKey=5ebc2e3a-46da-43d2-9c9f-8030fb911eb9&amp;type=base64Url&amp;id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWNjZXNzd2lyZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VsaWJyYXJ5LzRkYjhlMWU2LTBlOTctNGM5ZS1hMTM1LTM4NDFkNmRkM2I5ZC84OTA1MDIvaW1hZ2UucG5n&amp;key=43bc029eddc4b9bddce8edcbb1a64a04bd04015e9a2d8366ae1330ab8a7c7df028964cad314ec96cd89391bf2d6c527e5196c0e1bd87e9b83662079543546d83\"/></div></div></strong></p><p><strong>What is the Lawsuit About?</strong></p><p>The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.</p><p>These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.</p><p>On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.</p><p>Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/wq1\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.</p><p>As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\").</p><p>BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties. BFA intends to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of Globe Life stockholders and to ensure that the fiduciaries are held accountable for the Company's pervasive violations of the law.</p><p><strong>Click here if you are a long-term holder:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/wpb\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you are a current holder of Globe Life Inc. stock, you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

It is controlled by China. Smelting is an environmentally harmful\nprocess worse than C02 that can cause environmental damage (water, air).\nTailings from sulphide minerals in mining waste have the potential to\ncreate acid. China Controls 68-80% of nickel refining smelting, and\ncontrols 84% of the Indonesia Nickel Market. A report from the Brookings\nInstitute said that: Even if the U.S. and EU were to dig more minerals out\nof the ground, many of these minerals would need to be shipped overseas for\nconcentrating, refining, and smelting without significant increases in U.S.\nand European mineral refining and smelting capacity. The U.S., in\nparticular, will likely have to update and amend its mining regulatory\nregime. Governments will also have to onshore or friend-shore smelting and\nrefining capacity. The midstream part of the equation is likely to be the\nmost challenging, complicated by high investment costs and market\nconditions. Active Companies mentioned in the article include: First\nAtlantic Nickel Corp. (OTCQB: FANCF) (TSX-V: FAN), Alaska Energy Metals\nCorporation (TSX-V: AEMC) (OTCQB: AKEMF), Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F),\nGeneral Motors Co. (NYSE: GM), TMC the metals company Inc. (NASDAQ: TMC).\n\n     The U.S. Government (USGS) sees a better way saying: The development\nof awaruite deposits in other parts of Canada may help alleviate any\nprolonged shortage of nickel concentrate. Awaruite, a natural iron-nickel\nalloy, is much easier to concentrate than pentlandite, the principal\nsulfide of nickel. Awaruite is safer and more economical to process due to\nthe magnetic separation and concentration. It uses less chemicals, less\nenergy, can be processed directly in North America and since no smelting is\nrequired doesnt need to go to China. Awaruite means no burning, which\nreleases sulfur dioxide and other toxic emissions, and less risk of acid\nmine tailings accidents or contaminations (no sulphide minerals present).\n\n     A report from Science Direct said: Nickel is an important component of\nstainless steel and a wide range of applications which are critical for the\ntransition to clean energies including electric vehicle batteries. Awaruite\nis a native nickeliron alloy that has gained interest as a possible new\neconomic source of nickel. In the last decades, there have been discoveries\nof awaruite, mostly with more significant amounts of nickel sulphides, that\nhave demonstrated the potential for awaruite to contribute to the economics\nof a deposit. This study is focused on the very large Baptiste deposit in\ncentral British Columbia, Canada where awaruite is the primary nickel\nmineral. It concluded: Awaruite has the potential to be concentrated in a\nunique and valuable nickel concentrate of distinctive characteristics\nincluding its very high nickel content, which lowers both the downstream\ncosts and the carbon intensity. Furthermore, the negligible content of\nsulphur and penalty trace elements, such as mercury, antimony, and arsenic\nin a potential awaruite concentrate, minimizes the costs of refining it.\n\n     First Atlantic Nickel Corp. (OTCQB: FANCF) (TSX-V: FAN) Hosts\nStrategic Investor Site Visit, Expands Geological Team, and Reports\nMilestones on Infrastructure Upgrades at Atlantic Nickel Project - First\nAtlantic Nickel Corp. (FSE: P21) (\"First Atlantic\" or the \"Company\") is\npleased to provide an update on the progress at its wholly-owned Atlantic\nNickel Project in central Newfoundland, Canada (the \"Project\" or the\n\"Atlantic Nickel Project\"). The Company recently completed the first site\nvisit with a strategic corporate investor (the \"Strategic Investor\"), which\nincluded examining nickel-bearing occurrences and historical drill core.\nFirst Atlantic welcomes the Strategic Investor's support, knowledge, and\nexperience in mining project exploration and development.\n\n     Highlights:\n\n//st\n\n  * First site visit at Atlantic Nickel Project with Corporate Strategic\nInvestor completed.\n  * Awaruite identified as visible grains in previous drill core from\nAtlantic Lake Area.\n  * First bridge installed as part of road upgrade and development program,\nenabling year-round Project access.\n  * Technical Advisor, Dr. Ron Britten has conducted a site visit to\nexamine awaruite nickel occurrences and will help lead the charge to\ndiscover a potential large scale deposit.\n  * Permits filed for phase 2 of new all-weather road construction.\n  * Geological team with awaruite experience expanded to accelerate\ndistrict-scale exploration efforts along extensive 30 km trend.\n\n//et\n\n     Project Road Update: First Atlantic is also pleased to announce the\ninstallation of the first bridge as part of its infrastructure upgrade\nprogram on the Project. The Company anticipates the completion of two\nadditional bridges, allowing for the establishment of operations directly\non the Project site, enhancing future operational efficiency.\n\n     The installation of the first bridge marks a significant milestone in\nconducting large-scale district-size mining exploration operations. The\nroad will provide faster and closer access to additional awaruite zones\nthroughout the district, allowing for year-round exploration work and\ndrilling. Improved road access reduces the cost per meter of drilling,\nenabling significantly more drilling activities.\n\n     Exploration Updates: Preparations are underway for the Exploration\nCamp with a permit in place. The camp will serve as a strategic base for\non-site operations, enabling the exploration team to work efficiently in\nthe field. To ensure year-round access to the site, road upgrades are being\nimplemented, allowing for easy ground access regardless of the season.\n\n     The exploration program is focusing on grading and prioritizing\nawaruite outcrops, as well as sampling and mapping prospective drill\ntargets along the 30km trend. A LiDAR/Photos airborne program is also being\nplanned to aid in this work, providing high-resolution topographic data and\naerial imagery. The LiDAR data will help identify key geological\nstructures, while the aerial photos will be used to visually identify\noutcrops for the geological team to investigate on the ground. This\nintegrated approach will further support exploration and development\nefforts.\n\n     Technical Advisor, Dr. Ron Britten, has completed an initial site\nvisit and is working closely with the First Atlantic exploration team\non-site. With his decades of experience, including discovering the Baptiste\nawaruite deposit containing over 10 billion pounds of nickel, Dr. Britten\nwill enhance the program. Dr. Britten's efforts will help outline the best\noccurrences for targeting in the initial drill program planned for this\nyear. This large-scale district sampling program can continue during the\nroad construction phase necessary for full drilling operations.

The Ultium Platform can deliver power, range and scale beyond any previous GM hybrid or extended range EV technology. Modular and scalable, the Ultium Platform can use different chemistries and cell form factors, making it adaptable to changing needs and new technology insertions as they become available. Utilizing the battery technologies of its parent company, GM Defense can help solve the DoD's energy and energy storage challenges. The work performed in this new effort will provide insights into the performance and design considerations when batteries are used in more dynamic, high-power operations than would be faced by more typical applications. OECIF support plays a key role in the development of new power and energy technologies, which provide the DoD with advanced capabilities and help prevent power and energy from being a limiting factor.</p><p><strong>TMC the metals company Inc.

The cobalt sulfate was generated during bench-scale testing of TMC’s hydrometallurgical flowsheet design with SGS Canada Inc. (“SGS”). The test work was carried out at SGS’ Metallurgical Centre of Excellence testing facility in Lakefield, Ontario.</p><p>Based on samples of nickel-cobalt-copper matte first produced by TMC in 2021, the Extractive Metallurgy team at SGS tested TMC’s efficient flowsheet to process high-grade nickel-copper-cobalt matte directly to high-purity cobalt sulfate without making cobalt metal, while producing fertilizer byproducts instead of solid waste or tailings. This milestone follows last month’s successful production of nickel sulfate, a key raw material input used in the production of energy-dense electric vehicle batteries.</p><p><strong>About FN Media Group:</strong></p><p>At FN Media Group, via our top-rated online news portal at www.financialnewsmedia.com, we are one of the very few select firms providing top tier one syndicated news distribution, targeted ticker tag press releases and stock market news coverage for today’s emerging companies. #pressreleases #tickertagpressreleases</p><p><strong>Follow us on Facebook to receive emerging news updates:</strong><a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=H7cGPgydFNmm0qaTYjTL_hkuqnVvF6O0TiqIffedul7KZsUIErXxjW0zeReBTIH1hS0bmxBkbMhL6FDkW0urYw1fMktCpyQjlt5qCSEWajRvqHlGvyMTR70HkESTOg5i7iOQRq43orp0PSFd0bzqXg==\"><u>https://www.facebook.com/financialnewsmedia</u></a></p><p><strong>Follow us on Twitter for real time Breaking News:</strong><a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=H7cGPgydFNmm0qaTYjTL_tFQk3etAjjjGlmLdSGXVHCl7aU_L7_-7Tpt7bHf64dbQ6p4qVBliPCadyKQcepu6104qvnbLPd263mI3KUshrAaV4PNA8aA514i41xbdtUm\"><u>https://twitter.com/FNMgroup</u></a></p><p><strong>Follow us on LinkedIn:</strong><a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=H7cGPgydFNmm0qaTYjTL_mYAJFaiHcD-uwsItMrb0TgPEbcI8E_0qruKtBDUa5bpxs4AwmQk5ynO6ZBq60Ul7CyO5RxVK6AzbVcdO5qq92UKNa5nVu5ob_AMvIIHrD95KFlRS3XrSj4Zgrk5AKU4z74WTlCRg_duYtiDFS0MVow=\"><u>https://www.linkedin.com/in/financialnewsmedia/</u></a></p><p>DISCLAIMER: FN Media Group LLC (FNM), which owns and operates FinancialNewsMedia.com and MarketNewsUpdates.com, is a third party publisher and news dissemination service provider, which disseminates electronic information through multiple online media channels.

(\"UiPath\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:PATH) and certain of the Company's senior executives.</p><p><strong>If you suffered losses on your UiPath investment, you are encouraged to submit your information at</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/114e\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Investors have until August 19, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned <span>Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc.</span>, No. 1:24-cv-4702.

For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.</p><p>These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.</p><p>On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"</p><p>This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/114g\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

The complaint alleges that between February 13, 2023 and February 12, 2024, Teradata and certain of its senior executives made materially false and misleading statements related to: (a) the success of the company's recently expanded business model to market products to customers beyond their IT units; (b) the robustness of the company's pipeline and ability to timely close deals; and (c) the company's revenue growth prospects.</p><p>The complaint further alleges that, in reality, Teradata's expanded business model caused significant delays in the closing of large customer transactions. As a result, it is alleged that the company overstated the health of its pipeline and revenue growth prospects.</p><p>Investors allegedly began to learn the truth on December 7, 2023, when Teradata revealed that certain large deals could be delayed. On this news, the price of Teradata stock declined by $2.89 per share, or 6%, to close at $43.40 per share on December 7, 2023. Then, on February 12, 2024, Teradata announced that \"deal timing issues\" caused the company to miss its previously issued ARR guidance. On this news, the price of Teradata stock declined by $10.57 per share, or 22%, to close at $38.22 per share on February 13, 2024.</p><p>BFA Law encourages investors who lost money on their Teradata investment to submit your information to find out about your rights.</p><p><strong>Submit your information here:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/114o\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/teradata-corp-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in Teradata Corp. you may be eligible to lead the case on behalf of shareholders.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.</p><p>These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.</p><p>On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.</p><p>Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/114a\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

(\"UiPath\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:PATH) and certain of the Company's senior executives.</p><p><strong>If you suffered losses on your UiPath investment, you are encouraged to submit your information at</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/107a\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Investors have until August 19, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned <span>Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc.</span>, No. 1:24-cv-4702.

For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/107c\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.</p><p>These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.</p><p>On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.</p><p>Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring.

In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and \"re-baselin[e]\" its entire Defense business.</p><p>On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts. On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $4.32 per share, or more than 16%, from $25.80 per share on August 9, 2022, to $21.48 per share on August 10, 2022.</p><p>Defendants, however, continued to make false representations regarding the strength of the Defense segment. For instance, the Company assured investors that \"[n]otwithstanding the additional volatility\" from \"acute short-term headwinds for the Defense sector, management maintains a highly positive view of its growth potential over a multi-year period.\"</p><p>On November 14, 2023, CAE stated that certain legacy contracts continued to be plagued by cost overruns. CAE revealed that, within the Defense segment, the Company planned to \"retir[e] legacy contracts, which have been most affected by inflationary pressures.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $0.85 per share, or nearly 4%, from $21.92 per share on November 13, 2023, to $21.07 per share on November 14, 2023.</p><p>Three months later, on February 14, 2024, CAE announced that it \"sought to further accelerate the retirement of outstanding program risks, mainly associated with certain legacy Defense contracts that we entered into pre-COVID and have been most impacted by economic headwinds.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $2.01 per share, or nearly 10%, from $20.92 per share on February 13, 2024, to $18.91 per share on February 14, 2024.</p><p>Finally, after the close of trading on May 21, 2024, CAE announced a \"re-baselining of its Defense business, Defense impairments, [and] accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts.\" The Company stated that \"CAE has recorded a $568.0 million non-cash impairment of Defense goodwill,\" \"$90.3 million in unfavorable Defense contract profit adjustments as a result of accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts,\" and a \"$35.7 million impairment of related technology and other non-financial assets which are principally related to the Legacy Contracts.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $1.03 per share, or more than 5%, from $19.83 per share on May 21, 2024, to $18.80 per share on May 22, 2024.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/106r\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/cae-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in CAE, Inc. you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and \"re-baselin[e]\" its entire Defense business.</p><p>On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts.

For instance, the Company assured investors that \"[n]otwithstanding the additional volatility\" from \"acute short-term headwinds for the Defense sector, management maintains a highly positive view of its growth potential over a multi-year period.\"</p><p>On November 14, 2023, CAE stated that certain legacy contracts continued to be plagued by cost overruns. CAE revealed that, within the Defense segment, the Company planned to \"retir[e] legacy contracts, which have been most affected by inflationary pressures.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $0.85 per share, or nearly 4%, from $21.92 per share on November 13, 2023, to $21.07 per share on November 14, 2023.</p><p>Three months later, on February 14, 2024, CAE announced that it \"sought to further accelerate the retirement of outstanding program risks, mainly associated with certain legacy Defense contracts that we entered into pre-COVID and have been most impacted by economic headwinds.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $2.01 per share, or nearly 10%, from $20.92 per share on February 13, 2024, to $18.91 per share on February 14, 2024.</p><p>Finally, after the close of trading on May 21, 2024, CAE announced a \"re-baselining of its Defense business, Defense impairments, [and] accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts.\" The Company stated that \"CAE has recorded a $568.0 million non-cash impairment of Defense goodwill,\" \"$90.3 million in unfavorable Defense contract profit adjustments as a result of accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts,\" and a \"$35.7 million impairment of related technology and other non-financial assets which are principally related to the Legacy Contracts.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $1.03 per share, or more than 5%, from $19.83 per share on May 21, 2024, to $18.80 per share on May 22, 2024.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/zll\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/cae-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in CAE, Inc. you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/zsz\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.</p><p>These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.</p><p>On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.</p><p>Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring.

In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and \"re-baselin[e]\" its entire Defense business.</p><p>On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts.

For instance, the Company assured investors that \"[n]otwithstanding the additional volatility\" from \"acute short-term headwinds for the Defense sector, management maintains a highly positive view of its growth potential over a multi-year period.\"</p><p>On November 14, 2023, CAE stated that certain legacy contracts continued to be plagued by cost overruns. CAE revealed that, within the Defense segment, the Company planned to \"retir[e] legacy contracts, which have been most affected by inflationary pressures.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $0.85 per share, or nearly 4%, from $21.92 per share on November 13, 2023, to $21.07 per share on November 14, 2023.</p><p>Three months later, on February 14, 2024, CAE announced that it \"sought to further accelerate the retirement of outstanding program risks, mainly associated with certain legacy Defense contracts that we entered into pre-COVID and have been most impacted by economic headwinds.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $2.01 per share, or nearly 10%, from $20.92 per share on February 13, 2024, to $18.91 per share on February 14, 2024.</p><p>Finally, after the close of trading on May 21, 2024, CAE announced a \"re-baselining of its Defense business, Defense impairments, [and] accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts.\" The Company stated that \"CAE has recorded a $568.0 million non-cash impairment of Defense goodwill,\" \"$90.3 million in unfavorable Defense contract profit adjustments as a result of accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts,\" and a \"$35.7 million impairment of related technology and other non-financial assets which are principally related to the Legacy Contracts.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $1.03 per share, or more than 5%, from $19.83 per share on May 21, 2024, to $18.80 per share on May 22, 2024.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/y2x\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/cae-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in CAE, Inc. you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.</p><p>As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\").</p><p>BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties. BFA intends to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of Globe Life stockholders and to ensure that the fiduciaries are held accountable for the Company's pervasive violations of the law.</p><p><strong>Click here if you are a long-term holder:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/y3m\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you are a current holder of Globe Life Inc. stock, you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.</p><p>These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.</p><p>On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.</p><p>Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/y42\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned <span>Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc.</span>, No. 1:24-cv-4702.

For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/y48\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

On this news, the price of Teradata stock declined by $2.89 per share, or 6%, to close at $43.40 per share on December 7, 2023. Then, on February 12, 2024, Teradata announced that \"deal timing issues\" caused the company to miss its previously issued ARR guidance.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned <span>Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc.</span>, No. 1:24-cv-4702.

For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/x1o\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.</p><p>As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\").</p><p>BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties. BFA intends to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of Globe Life stockholders and to ensure that the fiduciaries are held accountable for the Company's pervasive violations of the law.</p><p><strong>Click here if you are a long-term holder:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/x15\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you are a current holder of Globe Life Inc. stock, you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

The complaint alleges that between February 13, 2023 and February 12, 2024, Teradata and certain of its senior executives made materially false and misleading statements related to: (a) the success of the company's recently expanded business model to market products to customers beyond their IT units; (b) the robustness of the company's pipeline and ability to timely close deals; and (c) the company's revenue growth prospects.</p><p>The complaint further alleges that, in reality, Teradata's expanded business model caused significant delays in the closing of large customer transactions. As a result, it is alleged that the company overstated the health of its pipeline and revenue growth prospects.</p><p>Investors allegedly began to learn the truth on December 7, 2023, when Teradata revealed that certain large deals could be delayed. On this news, the price of Teradata stock declined by $2.89 per share, or 6%, to close at $43.40 per share on December 7, 2023. Then, on February 12, 2024, Teradata announced that \"deal timing issues\" caused the company to miss its previously issued ARR guidance. On this news, the price of Teradata stock declined by $10.57 per share, or 22%, to close at $38.22 per share on February 13, 2024.</p><p>BFA Law encourages investors who lost money on their Teradata investment to submit your information to find out about your rights.</p><p><strong>Submit your information here:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/wri\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/teradata-corp-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in Teradata Corp. you may be eligible to lead the case on behalf of shareholders.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned <span>John Baxter v.

This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.</p><p>These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.</p><p>On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.</p><p>Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/wq1\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.</p><p>As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\").</p><p>BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties. BFA intends to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of Globe Life stockholders and to ensure that the fiduciaries are held accountable for the Company's pervasive violations of the law.</p><p><strong>Click here if you are a long-term holder:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/wpb\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you are a current holder of Globe Life Inc. stock, you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

BFA is investigating whether Salesforce and certain of its executives made materially false and/or misleading statements to investors related to Salesforce's customer buying environment and/or the company's sales execution abilities.</p><p><strong>Submit your information here:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/wom\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/salesforce-inc</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in Salesforce, Inc. you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

It is controlled by China. Smelting is an environmentally harmful\nprocess worse than C02 that can cause environmental damage (water, air).\nTailings from sulphide minerals in mining waste have the potential to\ncreate acid. China Controls 68-80% of nickel refining smelting, and\ncontrols 84% of the Indonesia Nickel Market. A report from the Brookings\nInstitute said that: Even if the U.S. and EU were to dig more minerals out\nof the ground, many of these minerals would need to be shipped overseas for\nconcentrating, refining, and smelting without significant increases in U.S.\nand European mineral refining and smelting capacity. The U.S., in\nparticular, will likely have to update and amend its mining regulatory\nregime. Governments will also have to onshore or friend-shore smelting and\nrefining capacity. The midstream part of the equation is likely to be the\nmost challenging, complicated by high investment costs and market\nconditions. Active Companies mentioned in the article include: First\nAtlantic Nickel Corp. (OTCQB: FANCF) (TSX-V: FAN), Alaska Energy Metals\nCorporation (TSX-V: AEMC) (OTCQB: AKEMF), Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F),\nGeneral Motors Co. (NYSE: GM), TMC the metals company Inc. (NASDAQ: TMC).\n\n     The U.S. Government (USGS) sees a better way saying: The development\nof awaruite deposits in other parts of Canada may help alleviate any\nprolonged shortage of nickel concentrate. Awaruite, a natural iron-nickel\nalloy, is much easier to concentrate than pentlandite, the principal\nsulfide of nickel. Awaruite is safer and more economical to process due to\nthe magnetic separation and concentration. It uses less chemicals, less\nenergy, can be processed directly in North America and since no smelting is\nrequired doesnt need to go to China. Awaruite means no burning, which\nreleases sulfur dioxide and other toxic emissions, and less risk of acid\nmine tailings accidents or contaminations (no sulphide minerals present).\n\n     A report from Science Direct said: Nickel is an important component of\nstainless steel and a wide range of applications which are critical for the\ntransition to clean energies including electric vehicle batteries. Awaruite\nis a native nickeliron alloy that has gained interest as a possible new\neconomic source of nickel. In the last decades, there have been discoveries\nof awaruite, mostly with more significant amounts of nickel sulphides, that\nhave demonstrated the potential for awaruite to contribute to the economics\nof a deposit. This study is focused on the very large Baptiste deposit in\ncentral British Columbia, Canada where awaruite is the primary nickel\nmineral. It concluded: Awaruite has the potential to be concentrated in a\nunique and valuable nickel concentrate of distinctive characteristics\nincluding its very high nickel content, which lowers both the downstream\ncosts and the carbon intensity. Furthermore, the negligible content of\nsulphur and penalty trace elements, such as mercury, antimony, and arsenic\nin a potential awaruite concentrate, minimizes the costs of refining it.\n\n     First Atlantic Nickel Corp. (OTCQB: FANCF) (TSX-V: FAN) Hosts\nStrategic Investor Site Visit, Expands Geological Team, and Reports\nMilestones on Infrastructure Upgrades at Atlantic Nickel Project - First\nAtlantic Nickel Corp. (FSE: P21) (\"First Atlantic\" or the \"Company\") is\npleased to provide an update on the progress at its wholly-owned Atlantic\nNickel Project in central Newfoundland, Canada (the \"Project\" or the\n\"Atlantic Nickel Project\"). The Company recently completed the first site\nvisit with a strategic corporate investor (the \"Strategic Investor\"), which\nincluded examining nickel-bearing occurrences and historical drill core.\nFirst Atlantic welcomes the Strategic Investor's support, knowledge, and\nexperience in mining project exploration and development.\n\n     Highlights:\n\n//st\n\n  * First site visit at Atlantic Nickel Project with Corporate Strategic\nInvestor completed.\n  * Awaruite identified as visible grains in previous drill core from\nAtlantic Lake Area.\n  * First bridge installed as part of road upgrade and development program,\nenabling year-round Project access.\n  * Technical Advisor, Dr. Ron Britten has conducted a site visit to\nexamine awaruite nickel occurrences and will help lead the charge to\ndiscover a potential large scale deposit.\n  * Permits filed for phase 2 of new all-weather road construction.\n  * Geological team with awaruite experience expanded to accelerate\ndistrict-scale exploration efforts along extensive 30 km trend.\n\n//et\n\n     Project Road Update: First Atlantic is also pleased to announce the\ninstallation of the first bridge as part of its infrastructure upgrade\nprogram on the Project. The Company anticipates the completion of two\nadditional bridges, allowing for the establishment of operations directly\non the Project site, enhancing future operational efficiency.\n\n     The installation of the first bridge marks a significant milestone in\nconducting large-scale district-size mining exploration operations. The\nroad will provide faster and closer access to additional awaruite zones\nthroughout the district, allowing for year-round exploration work and\ndrilling. Improved road access reduces the cost per meter of drilling,\nenabling significantly more drilling activities.\n\n     Exploration Updates: Preparations are underway for the Exploration\nCamp with a permit in place. The camp will serve as a strategic base for\non-site operations, enabling the exploration team to work efficiently in\nthe field. To ensure year-round access to the site, road upgrades are being\nimplemented, allowing for easy ground access regardless of the season.\n\n     The exploration program is focusing on grading and prioritizing\nawaruite outcrops, as well as sampling and mapping prospective drill\ntargets along the 30km trend. A LiDAR/Photos airborne program is also being\nplanned to aid in this work, providing high-resolution topographic data and\naerial imagery. The LiDAR data will help identify key geological\nstructures, while the aerial photos will be used to visually identify\noutcrops for the geological team to investigate on the ground. This\nintegrated approach will further support exploration and development\nefforts.\n\n     Technical Advisor, Dr. Ron Britten, has completed an initial site\nvisit and is working closely with the First Atlantic exploration team\non-site. With his decades of experience, including discovering the Baptiste\nawaruite deposit containing over 10 billion pounds of nickel, Dr. Britten\nwill enhance the program. Dr. Britten's efforts will help outline the best\noccurrences for targeting in the initial drill program planned for this\nyear. This large-scale district sampling program can continue during the\nroad construction phase necessary for full drilling operations.

The project, Evaluation of Electric Vehicle Batteries to Enable Directed Energy (EEVBEDE), is funded by the Operational Energy Innovation office of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), through its Operational Energy Capability Improvement Fund (OECIF). UTA PPEL will evaluate the technology to understand current capabilities of commercial automotive batteries under dynamic discharge and charge scenarios. The team's evaluation of the technology will help provide pathways and options for domestically supplied energy storage for future use in military platforms.</p><p>GM Defense is leveraging GM's Ultium Platform propulsion architecture, for evaluation and testing. The Ultium Platform can deliver power, range and scale beyond any previous GM hybrid or extended range EV technology. Modular and scalable, the Ultium Platform can use different chemistries and cell form factors, making it adaptable to changing needs and new technology insertions as they become available. Utilizing the battery technologies of its parent company, GM Defense can help solve the DoD's energy and energy storage challenges. The work performed in this new effort will provide insights into the performance and design considerations when batteries are used in more dynamic, high-power operations than would be faced by more typical applications. OECIF support plays a key role in the development of new power and energy technologies, which provide the DoD with advanced capabilities and help prevent power and energy from being a limiting factor.</p><p><strong>TMC the metals company Inc.

For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.</p><p>These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.</p><p>On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"</p><p>This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/114g\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

The complaint alleges that between February 13, 2023 and February 12, 2024, Teradata and certain of its senior executives made materially false and misleading statements related to: (a) the success of the company's recently expanded business model to market products to customers beyond their IT units; (b) the robustness of the company's pipeline and ability to timely close deals; and (c) the company's revenue growth prospects.</p><p>The complaint further alleges that, in reality, Teradata's expanded business model caused significant delays in the closing of large customer transactions. As a result, it is alleged that the company overstated the health of its pipeline and revenue growth prospects.</p><p>Investors allegedly began to learn the truth on December 7, 2023, when Teradata revealed that certain large deals could be delayed. On this news, the price of Teradata stock declined by $2.89 per share, or 6%, to close at $43.40 per share on December 7, 2023. Then, on February 12, 2024, Teradata announced that \"deal timing issues\" caused the company to miss its previously issued ARR guidance.

In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and \"re-baselin[e]\" its entire Defense business.</p><p>On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts. On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $4.32 per share, or more than 16%, from $25.80 per share on August 9, 2022, to $21.48 per share on August 10, 2022.</p><p>Defendants, however, continued to make false representations regarding the strength of the Defense segment. For instance, the Company assured investors that \"[n]otwithstanding the additional volatility\" from \"acute short-term headwinds for the Defense sector, management maintains a highly positive view of its growth potential over a multi-year period.\"</p><p>On November 14, 2023, CAE stated that certain legacy contracts continued to be plagued by cost overruns. CAE revealed that, within the Defense segment, the Company planned to \"retir[e] legacy contracts, which have been most affected by inflationary pressures.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $0.85 per share, or nearly 4%, from $21.92 per share on November 13, 2023, to $21.07 per share on November 14, 2023.</p><p>Three months later, on February 14, 2024, CAE announced that it \"sought to further accelerate the retirement of outstanding program risks, mainly associated with certain legacy Defense contracts that we entered into pre-COVID and have been most impacted by economic headwinds.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $2.01 per share, or nearly 10%, from $20.92 per share on February 13, 2024, to $18.91 per share on February 14, 2024.</p><p>Finally, after the close of trading on May 21, 2024, CAE announced a \"re-baselining of its Defense business, Defense impairments, [and] accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts.\" The Company stated that \"CAE has recorded a $568.0 million non-cash impairment of Defense goodwill,\" \"$90.3 million in unfavorable Defense contract profit adjustments as a result of accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts,\" and a \"$35.7 million impairment of related technology and other non-financial assets which are principally related to the Legacy Contracts.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $1.03 per share, or more than 5%, from $19.83 per share on May 21, 2024, to $18.80 per share on May 22, 2024.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/113c\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/cae-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in CAE, Inc. you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned <span>Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc.</span>, No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: <a href=\"https://pr.report/107b\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf</strong></a>.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"></p><div class=\"tr-image\"><div class=\"tr-image-components\"><img src=\"https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/48a667c9-526b-480c-8604-8fa80b651346/892101/image.png\" data-internal-src=\"https://rp.cp.dtc.reuint.com/Apps/NewsServices/images?apiKey=5ebc2e3a-46da-43d2-9c9f-8030fb911eb9&amp;type=base64Url&amp;id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWNjZXNzd2lyZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VsaWJyYXJ5LzQ4YTY2N2M5LTUyNmItNDgwYy04NjA0LThmYTgwYjY1MTM0Ni84OTIxMDEvaW1hZ2UucG5n&amp;key=c8d1eb51f1165474a736053c15a9c0c419950c0fac8a9978b4c3b869f0ce041bf218b1373b74b36cab19bb3d7a648a9c8dd53b7282bfb8127fa120f9ccf83067\"/></div></div><p></p><p><strong>What is the Lawsuit About?</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/107c\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.</p><p>These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.</p><p>On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.</p><p>Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring.

In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and \"re-baselin[e]\" its entire Defense business.</p><p>On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts. On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $4.32 per share, or more than 16%, from $25.80 per share on August 9, 2022, to $21.48 per share on August 10, 2022.</p><p>Defendants, however, continued to make false representations regarding the strength of the Defense segment. For instance, the Company assured investors that \"[n]otwithstanding the additional volatility\" from \"acute short-term headwinds for the Defense sector, management maintains a highly positive view of its growth potential over a multi-year period.\"</p><p>On November 14, 2023, CAE stated that certain legacy contracts continued to be plagued by cost overruns. CAE revealed that, within the Defense segment, the Company planned to \"retir[e] legacy contracts, which have been most affected by inflationary pressures.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $0.85 per share, or nearly 4%, from $21.92 per share on November 13, 2023, to $21.07 per share on November 14, 2023.</p><p>Three months later, on February 14, 2024, CAE announced that it \"sought to further accelerate the retirement of outstanding program risks, mainly associated with certain legacy Defense contracts that we entered into pre-COVID and have been most impacted by economic headwinds.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $2.01 per share, or nearly 10%, from $20.92 per share on February 13, 2024, to $18.91 per share on February 14, 2024.</p><p>Finally, after the close of trading on May 21, 2024, CAE announced a \"re-baselining of its Defense business, Defense impairments, [and] accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts.\" The Company stated that \"CAE has recorded a $568.0 million non-cash impairment of Defense goodwill,\" \"$90.3 million in unfavorable Defense contract profit adjustments as a result of accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts,\" and a \"$35.7 million impairment of related technology and other non-financial assets which are principally related to the Legacy Contracts.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $1.03 per share, or more than 5%, from $19.83 per share on May 21, 2024, to $18.80 per share on May 22, 2024.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/106r\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/cae-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in CAE, Inc. you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and \"re-baselin[e]\" its entire Defense business.</p><p>On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts. On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $4.32 per share, or more than 16%, from $25.80 per share on August 9, 2022, to $21.48 per share on August 10, 2022.</p><p>Defendants, however, continued to make false representations regarding the strength of the Defense segment. For instance, the Company assured investors that \"[n]otwithstanding the additional volatility\" from \"acute short-term headwinds for the Defense sector, management maintains a highly positive view of its growth potential over a multi-year period.\"</p><p>On November 14, 2023, CAE stated that certain legacy contracts continued to be plagued by cost overruns. CAE revealed that, within the Defense segment, the Company planned to \"retir[e] legacy contracts, which have been most affected by inflationary pressures.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $0.85 per share, or nearly 4%, from $21.92 per share on November 13, 2023, to $21.07 per share on November 14, 2023.</p><p>Three months later, on February 14, 2024, CAE announced that it \"sought to further accelerate the retirement of outstanding program risks, mainly associated with certain legacy Defense contracts that we entered into pre-COVID and have been most impacted by economic headwinds.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $2.01 per share, or nearly 10%, from $20.92 per share on February 13, 2024, to $18.91 per share on February 14, 2024.</p><p>Finally, after the close of trading on May 21, 2024, CAE announced a \"re-baselining of its Defense business, Defense impairments, [and] accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts.\" The Company stated that \"CAE has recorded a $568.0 million non-cash impairment of Defense goodwill,\" \"$90.3 million in unfavorable Defense contract profit adjustments as a result of accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts,\" and a \"$35.7 million impairment of related technology and other non-financial assets which are principally related to the Legacy Contracts.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $1.03 per share, or more than 5%, from $19.83 per share on May 21, 2024, to $18.80 per share on May 22, 2024.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/zll\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/cae-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in CAE, Inc. you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/zsz\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.</p><p>These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.</p><p>On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.</p><p>Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring.

In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and \"re-baselin[e]\" its entire Defense business.</p><p>On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts.

For instance, the Company assured investors that \"[n]otwithstanding the additional volatility\" from \"acute short-term headwinds for the Defense sector, management maintains a highly positive view of its growth potential over a multi-year period.\"</p><p>On November 14, 2023, CAE stated that certain legacy contracts continued to be plagued by cost overruns. CAE revealed that, within the Defense segment, the Company planned to \"retir[e] legacy contracts, which have been most affected by inflationary pressures.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $0.85 per share, or nearly 4%, from $21.92 per share on November 13, 2023, to $21.07 per share on November 14, 2023.</p><p>Three months later, on February 14, 2024, CAE announced that it \"sought to further accelerate the retirement of outstanding program risks, mainly associated with certain legacy Defense contracts that we entered into pre-COVID and have been most impacted by economic headwinds.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $2.01 per share, or nearly 10%, from $20.92 per share on February 13, 2024, to $18.91 per share on February 14, 2024.</p><p>Finally, after the close of trading on May 21, 2024, CAE announced a \"re-baselining of its Defense business, Defense impairments, [and] accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts.\" The Company stated that \"CAE has recorded a $568.0 million non-cash impairment of Defense goodwill,\" \"$90.3 million in unfavorable Defense contract profit adjustments as a result of accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts,\" and a \"$35.7 million impairment of related technology and other non-financial assets which are principally related to the Legacy Contracts.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $1.03 per share, or more than 5%, from $19.83 per share on May 21, 2024, to $18.80 per share on May 22, 2024.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/y2x\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/cae-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in CAE, Inc. you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.</p><p>As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\").</p><p>BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties. BFA intends to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of Globe Life stockholders and to ensure that the fiduciaries are held accountable for the Company's pervasive violations of the law.</p><p><strong>Click here if you are a long-term holder:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/y3m\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you are a current holder of Globe Life Inc. stock, you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.</p><p>These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.</p><p>On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.</p><p>Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/y42\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned <span>Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc.</span>, No. 1:24-cv-4702.

For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/y48\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

As a result, it is alleged that the company overstated the health of its pipeline and revenue growth prospects.</p><p>Investors allegedly began to learn the truth on December 7, 2023, when Teradata revealed that certain large deals could be delayed. On this news, the price of Teradata stock declined by $2.89 per share, or 6%, to close at $43.40 per share on December 7, 2023. Then, on February 12, 2024, Teradata announced that \"deal timing issues\" caused the company to miss its previously issued ARR guidance.

(\"UiPath\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:PATH) and certain of the Company's senior executives.</p><p><strong>If you suffered losses on your UiPath investment, you are encouraged to submit your information at</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/x1m\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Investors have until August 19, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned <span>Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc.</span>, No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: <a href=\"https://pr.report/x1n\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf</strong></a>.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"></p><div class=\"tr-image\"><div class=\"tr-image-components\"><img src=\"https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/ba8abe03-bd1f-4298-a101-0e3c55da1fab/890621/image.png\" data-internal-src=\"https://rp.cp.dtc.reuint.com/Apps/NewsServices/images?apiKey=5ebc2e3a-46da-43d2-9c9f-8030fb911eb9&amp;type=base64Url&amp;id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWNjZXNzd2lyZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VsaWJyYXJ5L2JhOGFiZTAzLWJkMWYtNDI5OC1hMTAxLTBlM2M1NWRhMWZhYi84OTA2MjEvaW1hZ2UucG5n&amp;key=682ed0bcb2af8441417c85793d4796d8454b102d47b9b819e1613fa6c0da5c4d0a5f0aa8b2400fb336ccdd0adbcc0beb6e8a9640c806dae553ab2a5266ca17ec\"/></div></div><p></p><p><strong>What is the Lawsuit About?</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/x1o\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.</p><p>As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\").</p><p>BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties. BFA intends to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of Globe Life stockholders and to ensure that the fiduciaries are held accountable for the Company's pervasive violations of the law.</p><p><strong>Click here if you are a long-term holder:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/x15\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you are a current holder of Globe Life Inc. stock, you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

The complaint alleges that between February 13, 2023 and February 12, 2024, Teradata and certain of its senior executives made materially false and misleading statements related to: (a) the success of the company's recently expanded business model to market products to customers beyond their IT units; (b) the robustness of the company's pipeline and ability to timely close deals; and (c) the company's revenue growth prospects.</p><p>The complaint further alleges that, in reality, Teradata's expanded business model caused significant delays in the closing of large customer transactions. As a result, it is alleged that the company overstated the health of its pipeline and revenue growth prospects.</p><p>Investors allegedly began to learn the truth on December 7, 2023, when Teradata revealed that certain large deals could be delayed. On this news, the price of Teradata stock declined by $2.89 per share, or 6%, to close at $43.40 per share on December 7, 2023. Then, on February 12, 2024, Teradata announced that \"deal timing issues\" caused the company to miss its previously issued ARR guidance. On this news, the price of Teradata stock declined by $10.57 per share, or 22%, to close at $38.22 per share on February 13, 2024.</p><p>BFA Law encourages investors who lost money on their Teradata investment to submit your information to find out about your rights.</p><p><strong>Submit your information here:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/wri\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/teradata-corp-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in Teradata Corp. you may be eligible to lead the case on behalf of shareholders.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned <span>John Baxter v.

This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.</p><p>These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.</p><p>On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.</p><p>Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/wq1\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.</p><p>As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\").</p><p>BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties. BFA intends to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of Globe Life stockholders and to ensure that the fiduciaries are held accountable for the Company's pervasive violations of the law.</p><p><strong>Click here if you are a long-term holder:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/wpb\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you are a current holder of Globe Life Inc. stock, you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

It is controlled by China. Smelting is an environmentally harmful\nprocess worse than C02 that can cause environmental damage (water, air).\nTailings from sulphide minerals in mining waste have the potential to\ncreate acid. China Controls 68-80% of nickel refining smelting, and\ncontrols 84% of the Indonesia Nickel Market. A report from the Brookings\nInstitute said that: Even if the U.S. and EU were to dig more minerals out\nof the ground, many of these minerals would need to be shipped overseas for\nconcentrating, refining, and smelting without significant increases in U.S.\nand European mineral refining and smelting capacity. The U.S., in\nparticular, will likely have to update and amend its mining regulatory\nregime. Governments will also have to onshore or friend-shore smelting and\nrefining capacity. The midstream part of the equation is likely to be the\nmost challenging, complicated by high investment costs and market\nconditions. Active Companies mentioned in the article include: First\nAtlantic Nickel Corp. (OTCQB: FANCF) (TSX-V: FAN), Alaska Energy Metals\nCorporation (TSX-V: AEMC) (OTCQB: AKEMF), Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F),\nGeneral Motors Co. (NYSE: GM), TMC the metals company Inc. (NASDAQ: TMC).\n\n     The U.S. Government (USGS) sees a better way saying: The development\nof awaruite deposits in other parts of Canada may help alleviate any\nprolonged shortage of nickel concentrate. Awaruite, a natural iron-nickel\nalloy, is much easier to concentrate than pentlandite, the principal\nsulfide of nickel. Awaruite is safer and more economical to process due to\nthe magnetic separation and concentration. It uses less chemicals, less\nenergy, can be processed directly in North America and since no smelting is\nrequired doesnt need to go to China. Awaruite means no burning, which\nreleases sulfur dioxide and other toxic emissions, and less risk of acid\nmine tailings accidents or contaminations (no sulphide minerals present).\n\n     A report from Science Direct said: Nickel is an important component of\nstainless steel and a wide range of applications which are critical for the\ntransition to clean energies including electric vehicle batteries. Awaruite\nis a native nickeliron alloy that has gained interest as a possible new\neconomic source of nickel. In the last decades, there have been discoveries\nof awaruite, mostly with more significant amounts of nickel sulphides, that\nhave demonstrated the potential for awaruite to contribute to the economics\nof a deposit. This study is focused on the very large Baptiste deposit in\ncentral British Columbia, Canada where awaruite is the primary nickel\nmineral. It concluded: Awaruite has the potential to be concentrated in a\nunique and valuable nickel concentrate of distinctive characteristics\nincluding its very high nickel content, which lowers both the downstream\ncosts and the carbon intensity. Furthermore, the negligible content of\nsulphur and penalty trace elements, such as mercury, antimony, and arsenic\nin a potential awaruite concentrate, minimizes the costs of refining it.\n\n     First Atlantic Nickel Corp. (OTCQB: FANCF) (TSX-V: FAN) Hosts\nStrategic Investor Site Visit, Expands Geological Team, and Reports\nMilestones on Infrastructure Upgrades at Atlantic Nickel Project - First\nAtlantic Nickel Corp. (FSE: P21) (\"First Atlantic\" or the \"Company\") is\npleased to provide an update on the progress at its wholly-owned Atlantic\nNickel Project in central Newfoundland, Canada (the \"Project\" or the\n\"Atlantic Nickel Project\"). The Company recently completed the first site\nvisit with a strategic corporate investor (the \"Strategic Investor\"), which\nincluded examining nickel-bearing occurrences and historical drill core.\nFirst Atlantic welcomes the Strategic Investor's support, knowledge, and\nexperience in mining project exploration and development.\n\n     Highlights:\n\n//st\n\n  * First site visit at Atlantic Nickel Project with Corporate Strategic\nInvestor completed.\n  * Awaruite identified as visible grains in previous drill core from\nAtlantic Lake Area.\n  * First bridge installed as part of road upgrade and development program,\nenabling year-round Project access.\n  * Technical Advisor, Dr. Ron Britten has conducted a site visit to\nexamine awaruite nickel occurrences and will help lead the charge to\ndiscover a potential large scale deposit.\n  * Permits filed for phase 2 of new all-weather road construction.\n  * Geological team with awaruite experience expanded to accelerate\ndistrict-scale exploration efforts along extensive 30 km trend.\n\n//et\n\n     Project Road Update: First Atlantic is also pleased to announce the\ninstallation of the first bridge as part of its infrastructure upgrade\nprogram on the Project. The Company anticipates the completion of two\nadditional bridges, allowing for the establishment of operations directly\non the Project site, enhancing future operational efficiency.\n\n     The installation of the first bridge marks a significant milestone in\nconducting large-scale district-size mining exploration operations. The\nroad will provide faster and closer access to additional awaruite zones\nthroughout the district, allowing for year-round exploration work and\ndrilling. Improved road access reduces the cost per meter of drilling,\nenabling significantly more drilling activities.\n\n     Exploration Updates: Preparations are underway for the Exploration\nCamp with a permit in place. The camp will serve as a strategic base for\non-site operations, enabling the exploration team to work efficiently in\nthe field. To ensure year-round access to the site, road upgrades are being\nimplemented, allowing for easy ground access regardless of the season.\n\n     The exploration program is focusing on grading and prioritizing\nawaruite outcrops, as well as sampling and mapping prospective drill\ntargets along the 30km trend. A LiDAR/Photos airborne program is also being\nplanned to aid in this work, providing high-resolution topographic data and\naerial imagery. The LiDAR data will help identify key geological\nstructures, while the aerial photos will be used to visually identify\noutcrops for the geological team to investigate on the ground. This\nintegrated approach will further support exploration and development\nefforts.\n\n     Technical Advisor, Dr. Ron Britten, has completed an initial site\nvisit and is working closely with the First Atlantic exploration team\non-site. With his decades of experience, including discovering the Baptiste\nawaruite deposit containing over 10 billion pounds of nickel, Dr. Britten\nwill enhance the program. Dr. Britten's efforts will help outline the best\noccurrences for targeting in the initial drill program planned for this\nyear. This large-scale district sampling program can continue during the\nroad construction phase necessary for full drilling operations.

Utilizing the battery technologies of its parent company, GM Defense can help solve the DoD's energy and energy storage challenges. The work performed in this new effort will provide insights into the performance and design considerations when batteries are used in more dynamic, high-power operations than would be faced by more typical applications. OECIF support plays a key role in the development of new power and energy technologies, which provide the DoD with advanced capabilities and help prevent power and energy from being a limiting factor.</p><p><strong>TMC the metals company Inc. (NASDAQ: TMC),</strong> an explorer of the world’s largest estimated undeveloped source of critical battery metals, recently <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=9Iv-myBYHLKrTe6EPHq4RdYLJ7VotZcsRPvG5tlaXzHV3y1iKAf0XIcGF9RXD5DJObHyN2r9Y2gKVno3gb04-DhQHqcstIBLaWH4luGRIKprCO2p65nW3PaXcUPBVDT7l8OIwAF40RZX8fFvShV5yg==\"><u>announced</u></a> that it has successfully produced the world’s first cobalt sulfate derived exclusively from seafloor polymetallic nodules. The cobalt sulfate was generated during bench-scale testing of TMC’s hydrometallurgical flowsheet design with SGS Canada Inc. (“SGS”). The test work was carried out at SGS’ Metallurgical Centre of Excellence testing facility in Lakefield, Ontario.</p><p>Based on samples of nickel-cobalt-copper matte first produced by TMC in 2021, the Extractive Metallurgy team at SGS tested TMC’s efficient flowsheet to process high-grade nickel-copper-cobalt matte directly to high-purity cobalt sulfate without making cobalt metal, while producing fertilizer byproducts instead of solid waste or tailings. This milestone follows last month’s successful production of nickel sulfate, a key raw material input used in the production of energy-dense electric vehicle batteries.</p><p><strong>About FN Media Group:</strong></p><p>At FN Media Group, via our top-rated online news portal at www.financialnewsmedia.com, we are one of the very few select firms providing top tier one syndicated news distribution, targeted ticker tag press releases and stock market news coverage for today’s emerging companies. #pressreleases #tickertagpressreleases</p><p><strong>Follow us on Facebook to receive emerging news updates:</strong><a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=H7cGPgydFNmm0qaTYjTL_hkuqnVvF6O0TiqIffedul7KZsUIErXxjW0zeReBTIH1hS0bmxBkbMhL6FDkW0urYw1fMktCpyQjlt5qCSEWajRvqHlGvyMTR70HkESTOg5i7iOQRq43orp0PSFd0bzqXg==\"><u>https://www.facebook.com/financialnewsmedia</u></a></p><p><strong>Follow us on Twitter for real time Breaking News:</strong><a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=H7cGPgydFNmm0qaTYjTL_tFQk3etAjjjGlmLdSGXVHCl7aU_L7_-7Tpt7bHf64dbQ6p4qVBliPCadyKQcepu6104qvnbLPd263mI3KUshrAaV4PNA8aA514i41xbdtUm\"><u>https://twitter.com/FNMgroup</u></a></p><p><strong>Follow us on LinkedIn:</strong><a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=H7cGPgydFNmm0qaTYjTL_mYAJFaiHcD-uwsItMrb0TgPEbcI8E_0qruKtBDUa5bpxs4AwmQk5ynO6ZBq60Ul7CyO5RxVK6AzbVcdO5qq92UKNa5nVu5ob_AMvIIHrD95KFlRS3XrSj4Zgrk5AKU4z74WTlCRg_duYtiDFS0MVow=\"><u>https://www.linkedin.com/in/financialnewsmedia/</u></a></p><p>DISCLAIMER: FN Media Group LLC (FNM), which owns and operates FinancialNewsMedia.com and MarketNewsUpdates.com, is a third party publisher and news dissemination service provider, which disseminates electronic information through multiple online media channels.

The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned <span>Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc.</span>, No. 1:24-cv-4702.

For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.</p><p>These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.</p><p>On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"</p><p>This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/114g\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

The complaint alleges that between February 13, 2023 and February 12, 2024, Teradata and certain of its senior executives made materially false and misleading statements related to: (a) the success of the company's recently expanded business model to market products to customers beyond their IT units; (b) the robustness of the company's pipeline and ability to timely close deals; and (c) the company's revenue growth prospects.</p><p>The complaint further alleges that, in reality, Teradata's expanded business model caused significant delays in the closing of large customer transactions. As a result, it is alleged that the company overstated the health of its pipeline and revenue growth prospects.</p><p>Investors allegedly began to learn the truth on December 7, 2023, when Teradata revealed that certain large deals could be delayed. On this news, the price of Teradata stock declined by $2.89 per share, or 6%, to close at $43.40 per share on December 7, 2023. Then, on February 12, 2024, Teradata announced that \"deal timing issues\" caused the company to miss its previously issued ARR guidance. On this news, the price of Teradata stock declined by $10.57 per share, or 22%, to close at $38.22 per share on February 13, 2024.</p><p>BFA Law encourages investors who lost money on their Teradata investment to submit your information to find out about your rights.</p><p><strong>Submit your information here:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/114o\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/teradata-corp-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in Teradata Corp. you may be eligible to lead the case on behalf of shareholders.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.</p><p>These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.</p><p>On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.</p><p>Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned <span>Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc.</span>, No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: <a href=\"https://pr.report/107b\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf</strong></a>.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"></p><div class=\"tr-image\"><div class=\"tr-image-components\"><img src=\"https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/48a667c9-526b-480c-8604-8fa80b651346/892101/image.png\" data-internal-src=\"https://rp.cp.dtc.reuint.com/Apps/NewsServices/images?apiKey=5ebc2e3a-46da-43d2-9c9f-8030fb911eb9&amp;type=base64Url&amp;id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWNjZXNzd2lyZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VsaWJyYXJ5LzQ4YTY2N2M5LTUyNmItNDgwYy04NjA0LThmYTgwYjY1MTM0Ni84OTIxMDEvaW1hZ2UucG5n&amp;key=c8d1eb51f1165474a736053c15a9c0c419950c0fac8a9978b4c3b869f0ce041bf218b1373b74b36cab19bb3d7a648a9c8dd53b7282bfb8127fa120f9ccf83067\"/></div></div><p></p><p><strong>What is the Lawsuit About?</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/107c\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.</p><p>These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.</p><p>On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.</p><p>Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring.

In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and \"re-baselin[e]\" its entire Defense business.</p><p>On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts. On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $4.32 per share, or more than 16%, from $25.80 per share on August 9, 2022, to $21.48 per share on August 10, 2022.</p><p>Defendants, however, continued to make false representations regarding the strength of the Defense segment. For instance, the Company assured investors that \"[n]otwithstanding the additional volatility\" from \"acute short-term headwinds for the Defense sector, management maintains a highly positive view of its growth potential over a multi-year period.\"</p><p>On November 14, 2023, CAE stated that certain legacy contracts continued to be plagued by cost overruns. CAE revealed that, within the Defense segment, the Company planned to \"retir[e] legacy contracts, which have been most affected by inflationary pressures.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $0.85 per share, or nearly 4%, from $21.92 per share on November 13, 2023, to $21.07 per share on November 14, 2023.</p><p>Three months later, on February 14, 2024, CAE announced that it \"sought to further accelerate the retirement of outstanding program risks, mainly associated with certain legacy Defense contracts that we entered into pre-COVID and have been most impacted by economic headwinds.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $2.01 per share, or nearly 10%, from $20.92 per share on February 13, 2024, to $18.91 per share on February 14, 2024.</p><p>Finally, after the close of trading on May 21, 2024, CAE announced a \"re-baselining of its Defense business, Defense impairments, [and] accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts.\" The Company stated that \"CAE has recorded a $568.0 million non-cash impairment of Defense goodwill,\" \"$90.3 million in unfavorable Defense contract profit adjustments as a result of accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts,\" and a \"$35.7 million impairment of related technology and other non-financial assets which are principally related to the Legacy Contracts.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $1.03 per share, or more than 5%, from $19.83 per share on May 21, 2024, to $18.80 per share on May 22, 2024.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/106r\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/cae-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in CAE, Inc. you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and \"re-baselin[e]\" its entire Defense business.</p><p>On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts. On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $4.32 per share, or more than 16%, from $25.80 per share on August 9, 2022, to $21.48 per share on August 10, 2022.</p><p>Defendants, however, continued to make false representations regarding the strength of the Defense segment. For instance, the Company assured investors that \"[n]otwithstanding the additional volatility\" from \"acute short-term headwinds for the Defense sector, management maintains a highly positive view of its growth potential over a multi-year period.\"</p><p>On November 14, 2023, CAE stated that certain legacy contracts continued to be plagued by cost overruns. CAE revealed that, within the Defense segment, the Company planned to \"retir[e] legacy contracts, which have been most affected by inflationary pressures.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $0.85 per share, or nearly 4%, from $21.92 per share on November 13, 2023, to $21.07 per share on November 14, 2023.</p><p>Three months later, on February 14, 2024, CAE announced that it \"sought to further accelerate the retirement of outstanding program risks, mainly associated with certain legacy Defense contracts that we entered into pre-COVID and have been most impacted by economic headwinds.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $2.01 per share, or nearly 10%, from $20.92 per share on February 13, 2024, to $18.91 per share on February 14, 2024.</p><p>Finally, after the close of trading on May 21, 2024, CAE announced a \"re-baselining of its Defense business, Defense impairments, [and] accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts.\" The Company stated that \"CAE has recorded a $568.0 million non-cash impairment of Defense goodwill,\" \"$90.3 million in unfavorable Defense contract profit adjustments as a result of accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts,\" and a \"$35.7 million impairment of related technology and other non-financial assets which are principally related to the Legacy Contracts.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $1.03 per share, or more than 5%, from $19.83 per share on May 21, 2024, to $18.80 per share on May 22, 2024.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/zll\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/cae-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in CAE, Inc. you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/zsz\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.</p><p>These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.</p><p>On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.</p><p>Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring.

In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and \"re-baselin[e]\" its entire Defense business.</p><p>On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts.

For instance, the Company assured investors that \"[n]otwithstanding the additional volatility\" from \"acute short-term headwinds for the Defense sector, management maintains a highly positive view of its growth potential over a multi-year period.\"</p><p>On November 14, 2023, CAE stated that certain legacy contracts continued to be plagued by cost overruns. CAE revealed that, within the Defense segment, the Company planned to \"retir[e] legacy contracts, which have been most affected by inflationary pressures.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $0.85 per share, or nearly 4%, from $21.92 per share on November 13, 2023, to $21.07 per share on November 14, 2023.</p><p>Three months later, on February 14, 2024, CAE announced that it \"sought to further accelerate the retirement of outstanding program risks, mainly associated with certain legacy Defense contracts that we entered into pre-COVID and have been most impacted by economic headwinds.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $2.01 per share, or nearly 10%, from $20.92 per share on February 13, 2024, to $18.91 per share on February 14, 2024.</p><p>Finally, after the close of trading on May 21, 2024, CAE announced a \"re-baselining of its Defense business, Defense impairments, [and] accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts.\" The Company stated that \"CAE has recorded a $568.0 million non-cash impairment of Defense goodwill,\" \"$90.3 million in unfavorable Defense contract profit adjustments as a result of accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts,\" and a \"$35.7 million impairment of related technology and other non-financial assets which are principally related to the Legacy Contracts.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $1.03 per share, or more than 5%, from $19.83 per share on May 21, 2024, to $18.80 per share on May 22, 2024.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/y2x\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/cae-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in CAE, Inc. you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.</p><p>As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\").</p><p>BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties. BFA intends to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of Globe Life stockholders and to ensure that the fiduciaries are held accountable for the Company's pervasive violations of the law.</p><p><strong>Click here if you are a long-term holder:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/y3m\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you are a current holder of Globe Life Inc. stock, you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.</p><p>These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.</p><p>On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.</p><p>Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/y42\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned <span>Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc.</span>, No. 1:24-cv-4702.

For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/y48\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

As a result, it is alleged that the company overstated the health of its pipeline and revenue growth prospects.</p><p>Investors allegedly began to learn the truth on December 7, 2023, when Teradata revealed that certain large deals could be delayed. On this news, the price of Teradata stock declined by $2.89 per share, or 6%, to close at $43.40 per share on December 7, 2023. Then, on February 12, 2024, Teradata announced that \"deal timing issues\" caused the company to miss its previously issued ARR guidance.

(\"UiPath\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:PATH) and certain of the Company's senior executives.</p><p><strong>If you suffered losses on your UiPath investment, you are encouraged to submit your information at</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/x1m\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Investors have until August 19, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned <span>Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc.</span>, No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: <a href=\"https://pr.report/x1n\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf</strong></a>.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"></p><div class=\"tr-image\"><div class=\"tr-image-components\"><img src=\"https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/ba8abe03-bd1f-4298-a101-0e3c55da1fab/890621/image.png\" data-internal-src=\"https://rp.cp.dtc.reuint.com/Apps/NewsServices/images?apiKey=5ebc2e3a-46da-43d2-9c9f-8030fb911eb9&amp;type=base64Url&amp;id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWNjZXNzd2lyZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VsaWJyYXJ5L2JhOGFiZTAzLWJkMWYtNDI5OC1hMTAxLTBlM2M1NWRhMWZhYi84OTA2MjEvaW1hZ2UucG5n&amp;key=682ed0bcb2af8441417c85793d4796d8454b102d47b9b819e1613fa6c0da5c4d0a5f0aa8b2400fb336ccdd0adbcc0beb6e8a9640c806dae553ab2a5266ca17ec\"/></div></div><p></p><p><strong>What is the Lawsuit About?</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/x1o\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.</p><p>As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\").</p><p>BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties. BFA intends to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of Globe Life stockholders and to ensure that the fiduciaries are held accountable for the Company's pervasive violations of the law.</p><p><strong>Click here if you are a long-term holder:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/x15\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you are a current holder of Globe Life Inc. stock, you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

The complaint alleges that between February 13, 2023 and February 12, 2024, Teradata and certain of its senior executives made materially false and misleading statements related to: (a) the success of the company's recently expanded business model to market products to customers beyond their IT units; (b) the robustness of the company's pipeline and ability to timely close deals; and (c) the company's revenue growth prospects.</p><p>The complaint further alleges that, in reality, Teradata's expanded business model caused significant delays in the closing of large customer transactions. As a result, it is alleged that the company overstated the health of its pipeline and revenue growth prospects.</p><p>Investors allegedly began to learn the truth on December 7, 2023, when Teradata revealed that certain large deals could be delayed. On this news, the price of Teradata stock declined by $2.89 per share, or 6%, to close at $43.40 per share on December 7, 2023. Then, on February 12, 2024, Teradata announced that \"deal timing issues\" caused the company to miss its previously issued ARR guidance. On this news, the price of Teradata stock declined by $10.57 per share, or 22%, to close at $38.22 per share on February 13, 2024.</p><p>BFA Law encourages investors who lost money on their Teradata investment to submit your information to find out about your rights.</p><p><strong>Submit your information here:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/wri\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/teradata-corp-investigation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in Teradata Corp. you may be eligible to lead the case on behalf of shareholders.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned <span>John Baxter v.

This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.</p><p>These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.</p><p>On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.</p><p>Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.</p><p><strong>Click here if you suffered losses:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/wq1\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.</p><p>All representation is on a contingency fee basis, <strong>there is no cost to you</strong>.

The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.</p><p>As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\").</p><p>BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties. BFA intends to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of Globe Life stockholders and to ensure that the fiduciaries are held accountable for the Company's pervasive violations of the law.</p><p><strong>Click here if you are a long-term holder:</strong><a href=\"https://pr.report/wpb\"><strong>https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p><p>If you are a current holder of Globe Life Inc. stock, you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

It is controlled by China. Smelting is an environmentally harmful\nprocess worse than C02 that can cause environmental damage (water, air).\nTailings from sulphide minerals in mining waste have the potential to\ncreate acid. China Controls 68-80% of nickel refining smelting, and\ncontrols 84% of the Indonesia Nickel Market. A report from the Brookings\nInstitute said that: Even if the U.S. and EU were to dig more minerals out\nof the ground, many of these minerals would need to be shipped overseas for\nconcentrating, refining, and smelting without significant increases in U.S.\nand European mineral refining and smelting capacity. The U.S., in\nparticular, will likely have to update and amend its mining regulatory\nregime. Governments will also have to onshore or friend-shore smelting and\nrefining capacity. The midstream part of the equation is likely to be the\nmost challenging, complicated by high investment costs and market\nconditions. Active Companies mentioned in the article include: First\nAtlantic Nickel Corp. (OTCQB: FANCF) (TSX-V: FAN), Alaska Energy Metals\nCorporation (TSX-V: AEMC) (OTCQB: AKEMF), Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F),\nGeneral Motors Co. (NYSE: GM), TMC the metals company Inc. (NASDAQ: TMC).\n\n     The U.S. Government (USGS) sees a better way saying: The development\nof awaruite deposits in other parts of Canada may help alleviate any\nprolonged shortage of nickel concentrate. Awaruite, a natural iron-nickel\nalloy, is much easier to concentrate than pentlandite, the principal\nsulfide of nickel. Awaruite is safer and more economical to process due to\nthe magnetic separation and concentration. It uses less chemicals, less\nenergy, can be processed directly in North America and since no smelting is\nrequired doesnt need to go to China. Awaruite means no burning, which\nreleases sulfur dioxide and other toxic emissions, and less risk of acid\nmine tailings accidents or contaminations (no sulphide minerals present).\n\n     A report from Science Direct said: Nickel is an important component of\nstainless steel and a wide range of applications which are critical for the\ntransition to clean energies including electric vehicle batteries. Awaruite\nis a native nickeliron alloy that has gained interest as a possible new\neconomic source of nickel. In the last decades, there have been discoveries\nof awaruite, mostly with more significant amounts of nickel sulphides, that\nhave demonstrated the potential for awaruite to contribute to the economics\nof a deposit. This study is focused on the very large Baptiste deposit in\ncentral British Columbia, Canada where awaruite is the primary nickel\nmineral. It concluded: Awaruite has the potential to be concentrated in a\nunique and valuable nickel concentrate of distinctive characteristics\nincluding its very high nickel content, which lowers both the downstream\ncosts and the carbon intensity.

         ".storyContent * PALM BEACH, Fla., July  29, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FinancialNewsMedia.com News Commentary - The refining of sulfide nickel deposits usually requires a smelting capacity not present today in North America. It is controlled by China. Smelting is an environmentally harmful process worse than C02 that can cause environmental damage (water, air). Tailings from sulphide minerals in mining waste have the potential to create acid. China Controls 68-80% of nickel refining smelting, and controls 84% of the Indonesia Nickel Market. A report from the Brookings Institute said that: “Even if the U.S. and EU were to dig more minerals out of the ground, many of these minerals would need to be shipped overseas for concentrating, refining, and smelting without significant increases in U.S. and European mineral refining and smelting capacity. The U.S., in particular, will likely have to update and amend its mining regulatory regime. Governments will also have to onshore or “friend-shore” smelting and refining capacity. The midstream part of the equation is likely to be the most challenging, complicated by high investment costs and market conditions.” Active Companies mentioned in the article include: First Atlantic Nickel Corp. (OTCQB: FANCF) (TSX-V: FAN), Alaska Energy Metals Corporation (TSX-V: AEMC) (OTCQB: AKEMF), Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F), General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM), TMC the metals company Inc. (NASDAQ: TMC).The U.S. Government (USGS) sees a better way saying: “The development of awaruite deposits in other parts of Canada may help alleviate any prolonged shortage of nickel concentrate. Awaruite, a natural iron-nickel alloy, is much easier to concentrate than pentlandite, the principal sulfide of nickel. Awaruite is safer and more economical to process due to the magnetic separation and concentration. It uses less chemicals, less energy, can be processed directly in North America and since no smelting is required doesn’t need to go to China. Awaruite means no burning, which releases sulfur dioxide and other toxic emissions, and less risk of acid mine tailings accidents or contaminations (no sulphide minerals present).”A report from Science Direct said: “Nickel is an important component of stainless steel and a wide range of applications which are critical for the transition to clean energies including electric vehicle batteries. Awaruite is a native nickel–iron alloy that has gained interest as a possible new economic source of nickel. In the last decades, there have been discoveries of awaruite, mostly with more significant amounts of nickel sulphides, that have demonstrated the potential for awaruite to contribute to the economics of a deposit. This study is focused on the very large Baptiste deposit in central British Columbia, Canada where awaruite is the primary nickel mineral.” It concluded: “Awaruite has the potential to be concentrated in a unique and valuable nickel concentrate of distinctive characteristics including its very high nickel content, which lowers both the downstream costs and the carbon intensity. Furthermore, the negligible content of sulphur and penalty trace elements, such as mercury, antimony, and arsenic in a potential awaruite concentrate, minimizes the costs of refining it.”First Atlantic Nickel Corp.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

The complaint alleges that between February 13, 2023 and February 12, 2024, Teradata and certain of its senior executives made materially false and misleading statements related to: (a) the success of the company's recently expanded business model to market products to customers beyond their IT units; (b) the robustness of the company's pipeline and ability to timely close deals; and (c) the company's revenue growth prospects.The complaint further alleges that, in reality, Teradata's expanded business model caused significant delays in the closing of large customer transactions. As a result, it is alleged that the company overstated the health of its pipeline and revenue growth prospects.Investors allegedly began to learn the truth on December 7, 2023, when Teradata revealed that certain large deals could be delayed. On this news, the price of Teradata stock declined by $2.89 per share, or 6%, to close at $43.40 per share on December 7, 2023.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

A copy of the lawsuit can be found here: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/CAEComplaint.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning significant cost overruns in CAE's Defense and Security (\"Defense\") segment caused by several fixed-price, long-term Defense contracts entered prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and \"re-baselin[e]\" its entire Defense business.On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

(Nasdaq:MDB) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your MongoDB investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.Investors have until September 9, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

A copy of the lawsuit can be found here: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/CAEComplaint.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning significant cost overruns in CAE's Defense and Security (\"Defense\") segment caused by several fixed-price, long-term Defense contracts entered prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and \"re-baselin[e]\" its entire Defense business.On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts. On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $4.32 per share, or more than 16%, from $25.80 per share on August 9, 2022, to $21.48 per share on August 10, 2022.Defendants, however, continued to make false representations regarding the strength of the Defense segment. For instance, the Company assured investors that \"[n]otwithstanding the additional volatility\" from \"acute short-term headwinds for the Defense sector, management maintains a highly positive view of its growth potential over a multi-year period.\"On November 14, 2023, CAE stated that certain legacy contracts continued to be plagued by cost overruns.

(\"CAE\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:CAE) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered a loss on your CAE investment, please submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases/cae-inc-investigation.The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in CAE who purchased or acquired CAE stock on an exchange in the United States between February 11, 2022 and May 21, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Norbert Gamache v. CAE Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05360. A copy of the lawsuit can be found here: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/CAEComplaint.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning significant cost overruns in CAE's Defense and Security (\"Defense\") segment caused by several fixed-price, long-term Defense contracts entered prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and \"re-baselin[e]\" its entire Defense business.On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts. On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $4.32 per share, or more than 16%, from $25.80 per share on August 9, 2022, to $21.48 per share on August 10, 2022.Defendants, however, continued to make false representations regarding the strength of the Defense segment. For instance, the Company assured investors that \"[n]otwithstanding the additional volatility\" from \"acute short-term headwinds for the Defense sector, management maintains a highly positive view of its growth potential over a multi-year period.\"On November 14, 2023, CAE stated that certain legacy contracts continued to be plagued by cost overruns. CAE revealed that, within the Defense segment, the Company planned to \"retir[e] legacy contracts, which have been most affected by inflationary pressures.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $0.85 per share, or nearly 4%, from $21.92 per share on November 13, 2023, to $21.07 per share on November 14, 2023.Three months later, on February 14, 2024, CAE announced that it \"sought to further accelerate the retirement of outstanding program risks, mainly associated with certain legacy Defense contracts that we entered into pre-COVID and have been most impacted by economic headwinds.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $2.01 per share, or nearly 10%, from $20.92 per share on February 13, 2024, to $18.91 per share on February 14, 2024.Finally, after the close of trading on May 21, 2024, CAE announced a \"re-baselining of its Defense business, Defense impairments, [and] accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts.\" The Company stated that \"CAE has recorded a $568.0 million non-cash impairment of Defense goodwill,\" \"$90.3 million in unfavorable Defense contract profit adjustments as a result of accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts,\" and a \"$35.7 million impairment of related technology and other non-financial assets which are principally related to the Legacy Contracts.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $1.03 per share, or more than 5%, from $19.83 per share on May 21, 2024, to $18.80 per share on May 22, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/cae-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in CAE, Inc. you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

(\"CAE\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:CAE) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered a loss on your CAE investment, please submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases/cae-inc-investigation.The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in CAE who purchased or acquired CAE stock on an exchange in the United States between February 11, 2022 and May 21, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Norbert Gamache v. CAE Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05360. A copy of the lawsuit can be found here: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/CAEComplaint.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning significant cost overruns in CAE's Defense and Security (\"Defense\") segment caused by several fixed-price, long-term Defense contracts entered prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and \"re-baselin[e]\" its entire Defense business.On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts. On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $4.32 per share, or more than 16%, from $25.80 per share on August 9, 2022, to $21.48 per share on August 10, 2022.Defendants, however, continued to make false representations regarding the strength of the Defense segment. For instance, the Company assured investors that \"[n]otwithstanding the additional volatility\" from \"acute short-term headwinds for the Defense sector, management maintains a highly positive view of its growth potential over a multi-year period.\"On November 14, 2023, CAE stated that certain legacy contracts continued to be plagued by cost overruns. CAE revealed that, within the Defense segment, the Company planned to \"retir[e] legacy contracts, which have been most affected by inflationary pressures.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $0.85 per share, or nearly 4%, from $21.92 per share on November 13, 2023, to $21.07 per share on November 14, 2023.Three months later, on February 14, 2024, CAE announced that it \"sought to further accelerate the retirement of outstanding program risks, mainly associated with certain legacy Defense contracts that we entered into pre-COVID and have been most impacted by economic headwinds.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $2.01 per share, or nearly 10%, from $20.92 per share on February 13, 2024, to $18.91 per share on February 14, 2024.Finally, after the close of trading on May 21, 2024, CAE announced a \"re-baselining of its Defense business, Defense impairments, [and] accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts.\" The Company stated that \"CAE has recorded a $568.0 million non-cash impairment of Defense goodwill,\" \"$90.3 million in unfavorable Defense contract profit adjustments as a result of accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts,\" and a \"$35.7 million impairment of related technology and other non-financial assets which are principally related to the Legacy Contracts.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $1.03 per share, or more than 5%, from $19.83 per share on May 21, 2024, to $18.80 per share on May 22, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/cae-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in CAE, Inc. you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

(NYSE:GL) and its directors and certain senior executives for breaches of their fiduciary duties by failing to stop, and/or condoning, pervasive fraud and sexual harassment at the Company.If you are a long-term holder of Globe Life, you are encouraged to submit your information at: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.Investigation Details:A recent investor report has exposed troubling allegations that Globe Life is engaged in widespread insurance fraud. The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\").BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties. BFA intends to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of Globe Life stockholders and to ensure that the fiduciaries are held accountable for the Company's pervasive violations of the law.Click here if you are a long-term holder:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.What Can You Do?If you are a current holder of Globe Life Inc. stock, you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

(Nasdaq:MDB) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your MongoDB investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.Investors have until September 9, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

(\"UiPath\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:PATH) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your UiPath investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.Investors have until August 19, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

(NYSE:GL) and its directors and certain senior executives for breaches of their fiduciary duties by failing to stop, and/or condoning, pervasive fraud and sexual harassment at the Company.If you are a long-term holder of Globe Life, you are encouraged to submit your information at: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.Investigation Details:A recent investor report has exposed troubling allegations that Globe Life is engaged in widespread insurance fraud. The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\").BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties. BFA intends to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of Globe Life stockholders and to ensure that the fiduciaries are held accountable for the Company's pervasive violations of the law.Click here if you are a long-term holder:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.What Can You Do?If you are a current holder of Globe Life Inc. stock, you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

(NYSE:TDC) securities class action lawsuit.If you invested in Teradata, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases/teradata-corp-investigation.Why is Teradata being Sued?On June 16, 2024, Teradata was sued for violations of the federal securities laws. The complaint alleges that between February 13, 2023 and February 12, 2024, Teradata and certain of its senior executives made materially false and misleading statements related to: (a) the success of the company's recently expanded business model to market products to customers beyond their IT units; (b) the robustness of the company's pipeline and ability to timely close deals; and (c) the company's revenue growth prospects.The complaint further alleges that, in reality, Teradata's expanded business model caused significant delays in the closing of large customer transactions. As a result, it is alleged that the company overstated the health of its pipeline and revenue growth prospects.Investors allegedly began to learn the truth on December 7, 2023, when Teradata revealed that certain large deals could be delayed. On this news, the price of Teradata stock declined by $2.89 per share, or 6%, to close at $43.40 per share on December 7, 2023. Then, on February 12, 2024, Teradata announced that \"deal timing issues\" caused the company to miss its previously issued ARR guidance.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

It is controlled by China. Smelting is an environmentally harmful\nprocess worse than C02 that can cause environmental damage (water, air).\nTailings from sulphide minerals in mining waste have the potential to\ncreate acid. China Controls 68-80% of nickel refining smelting, and\ncontrols 84% of the Indonesia Nickel Market. A report from the Brookings\nInstitute said that: Even if the U.S. and EU were to dig more minerals out\nof the ground, many of these minerals would need to be shipped overseas for\nconcentrating, refining, and smelting without significant increases in U.S.\nand European mineral refining and smelting capacity. The U.S., in\nparticular, will likely have to update and amend its mining regulatory\nregime. Governments will also have to onshore or friend-shore smelting and\nrefining capacity. The midstream part of the equation is likely to be the\nmost challenging, complicated by high investment costs and market\nconditions. Active Companies mentioned in the article include: First\nAtlantic Nickel Corp. (OTCQB: FANCF) (TSX-V: FAN), Alaska Energy Metals\nCorporation (TSX-V: AEMC) (OTCQB: AKEMF), Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F),\nGeneral Motors Co. (NYSE: GM), TMC the metals company Inc. (NASDAQ: TMC).\n\n     The U.S. Government (USGS) sees a better way saying: The development\nof awaruite deposits in other parts of Canada may help alleviate any\nprolonged shortage of nickel concentrate. Awaruite, a natural iron-nickel\nalloy, is much easier to concentrate than pentlandite, the principal\nsulfide of nickel. Awaruite is safer and more economical to process due to\nthe magnetic separation and concentration. It uses less chemicals, less\nenergy, can be processed directly in North America and since no smelting is\nrequired doesnt need to go to China. Awaruite means no burning, which\nreleases sulfur dioxide and other toxic emissions, and less risk of acid\nmine tailings accidents or contaminations (no sulphide minerals present).\n\n     A report from Science Direct said: Nickel is an important component of\nstainless steel and a wide range of applications which are critical for the\ntransition to clean energies including electric vehicle batteries. Awaruite\nis a native nickeliron alloy that has gained interest as a possible new\neconomic source of nickel. In the last decades, there have been discoveries\nof awaruite, mostly with more significant amounts of nickel sulphides, that\nhave demonstrated the potential for awaruite to contribute to the economics\nof a deposit. This study is focused on the very large Baptiste deposit in\ncentral British Columbia, Canada where awaruite is the primary nickel\nmineral. It concluded: Awaruite has the potential to be concentrated in a\nunique and valuable nickel concentrate of distinctive characteristics\nincluding its very high nickel content, which lowers both the downstream\ncosts and the carbon intensity. Furthermore, the negligible content of\nsulphur and penalty trace elements, such as mercury, antimony, and arsenic\nin a potential awaruite concentrate, minimizes the costs of refining it.\n\n     First Atlantic Nickel Corp. (OTCQB: FANCF) (TSX-V: FAN) Hosts\nStrategic Investor Site Visit, Expands Geological Team, and Reports\nMilestones on Infrastructure Upgrades at Atlantic Nickel Project - First\nAtlantic Nickel Corp. (FSE: P21) (\"First Atlantic\" or the \"Company\") is\npleased to provide an update on the progress at its wholly-owned Atlantic\nNickel Project in central Newfoundland, Canada (the \"Project\" or the\n\"Atlantic Nickel Project\"). The Company recently completed the first site\nvisit with a strategic corporate investor (the \"Strategic Investor\"), which\nincluded examining nickel-bearing occurrences and historical drill core.\nFirst Atlantic welcomes the Strategic Investor's support, knowledge, and\nexperience in mining project exploration and development.\n\n     Highlights:\n\n//st\n\n  * First site visit at Atlantic Nickel Project with Corporate Strategic\nInvestor completed.\n  * Awaruite identified as visible grains in previous drill core from\nAtlantic Lake Area.\n  * First bridge installed as part of road upgrade and development program,\nenabling year-round Project access.\n  * Technical Advisor, Dr. Ron Britten has conducted a site visit to\nexamine awaruite nickel occurrences and will help lead the charge to\ndiscover a potential large scale deposit.\n  * Permits filed for phase 2 of new all-weather road construction.\n  * Geological team with awaruite experience expanded to accelerate\ndistrict-scale exploration efforts along extensive 30 km trend.\n\n//et\n\n     Project Road Update: First Atlantic is also pleased to announce the\ninstallation of the first bridge as part of its infrastructure upgrade\nprogram on the Project. The Company anticipates the completion of two\nadditional bridges, allowing for the establishment of operations directly\non the Project site, enhancing future operational efficiency.\n\n     The installation of the first bridge marks a significant milestone in\nconducting large-scale district-size mining exploration operations. The\nroad will provide faster and closer access to additional awaruite zones\nthroughout the district, allowing for year-round exploration work and\ndrilling. Improved road access reduces the cost per meter of drilling,\nenabling significantly more drilling activities.\n\n     Exploration Updates: Preparations are underway for the Exploration\nCamp with a permit in place. The camp will serve as a strategic base for\non-site operations, enabling the exploration team to work efficiently in\nthe field. To ensure year-round access to the site, road upgrades are being\nimplemented, allowing for easy ground access regardless of the season.\n\n     The exploration program is focusing on grading and prioritizing\nawaruite outcrops, as well as sampling and mapping prospective drill\ntargets along the 30km trend. A LiDAR/Photos airborne program is also being\nplanned to aid in this work, providing high-resolution topographic data and\naerial imagery. The LiDAR data will help identify key geological\nstructures, while the aerial photos will be used to visually identify\noutcrops for the geological team to investigate on the ground. This\nintegrated approach will further support exploration and development\nefforts.\n\n     Technical Advisor, Dr. Ron Britten, has completed an initial site\nvisit and is working closely with the First Atlantic exploration team\non-site. With his decades of experience, including discovering the Baptiste\nawaruite deposit containing over 10 billion pounds of nickel, Dr. Britten\nwill enhance the program. Dr. Britten's efforts will help outline the best\noccurrences for targeting in the initial drill program planned for this\nyear. This large-scale district sampling program can continue during the\nroad construction phase necessary for full drilling operations.

         "PALM BEACH, Fla., July  29, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FinancialNewsMedia.com News Commentary - The refining of sulfide nickel deposits usually requires a smelting capacity not present today in North America. It is controlled by China. Smelting is an environmentally harmful process worse than C02 that can cause environmental damage (water, air). Tailings from sulphide minerals in mining waste have the potential to create acid. China Controls 68-80% of nickel refining smelting, and controls 84% of the Indonesia Nickel Market. A report from the Brookings Institute said that: “Even if the U.S. and EU were to dig more minerals out of the ground, many of these minerals would need to be shipped overseas for concentrating, refining, and smelting without significant increases in U.S. and European mineral refining and smelting capacity. The U.S., in particular, will likely have to update and amend its mining regulatory regime. Governments will also have to onshore or “friend-shore” smelting and refining capacity. The midstream part of the equation is likely to be the most challenging, complicated by high investment costs and market conditions.” Active Companies mentioned in the article include: First Atlantic Nickel Corp. (OTCQB: FANCF) (TSX-V: FAN), Alaska Energy Metals Corporation (TSX-V: AEMC) (OTCQB: AKEMF), Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F), General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM), TMC the metals company Inc. (NASDAQ: TMC).The U.S. Government (USGS) sees a better way saying: “The development of awaruite deposits in other parts of Canada may help alleviate any prolonged shortage of nickel concentrate. Awaruite, a natural iron-nickel alloy, is much easier to concentrate than pentlandite, the principal sulfide of nickel. Awaruite is safer and more economical to process due to the magnetic separation and concentration. It uses less chemicals, less energy, can be processed directly in North America and since no smelting is required doesn’t need to go to China. Awaruite means no burning, which releases sulfur dioxide and other toxic emissions, and less risk of acid mine tailings accidents or contaminations (no sulphide minerals present).”A report from Science Direct said: “Nickel is an important component of stainless steel and a wide range of applications which are critical for the transition to clean energies including electric vehicle batteries. Awaruite is a native nickel–iron alloy that has gained interest as a possible new economic source of nickel. In the last decades, there have been discoveries of awaruite, mostly with more significant amounts of nickel sulphides, that have demonstrated the potential for awaruite to contribute to the economics of a deposit. This study is focused on the very large Baptiste deposit in central British Columbia, Canada where awaruite is the primary nickel mineral.” It concluded: “Awaruite has the potential to be concentrated in a unique and valuable nickel concentrate of distinctive characteristics including its very high nickel content, which lowers both the downstream costs and the carbon intensity. Furthermore, the negligible content of sulphur and penalty trace elements, such as mercury, antimony, and arsenic in a potential awaruite concentrate, minimizes the costs of refining it.”First Atlantic Nickel Corp. (OTCQB: FANCF) (TSX-V: FAN) Hosts Strategic Investor Site Visit, Expands Geological Team, and Reports Milestones on Infrastructure Upgrades at Atlantic Nickel Project - First Atlantic Nickel Corp. (FSE: P21) (\"First Atlantic\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to provide an update on the progress at its wholly-owned Atlantic Nickel Project in central Newfoundland, Canada (the \"Project\" or the \"Atlantic Nickel Project\"). The Company recently completed the first site visit with a strategic corporate investor (the \"Strategic Investor\"), which included examining nickel-bearing occurrences and historical drill core. First Atlantic welcomes the Strategic Investor's support, knowledge, and experience in mining project exploration and development.Highlights:First site visit at Atlantic Nickel Project with Corporate Strategic Investor completed.Awaruite identified as visible grains in previous drill core from Atlantic Lake Area.First bridge installed as part of road upgrade and development program, enabling year-round Project access.Technical Advisor, Dr. Ron Britten has conducted a site visit to examine awaruite nickel occurrences and will help lead the charge to discover a potential large scale deposit.Permits filed for phase 2 of new all-weather road construction.Geological team with awaruite experience expanded to accelerate district-scale exploration efforts along extensive 30 km trend.Project Road Update: First Atlantic is also pleased to announce the installation of the first bridge as part of its infrastructure upgrade program on the Project. The Company anticipates the completion of two additional bridges, allowing for the establishment of operations directly on the Project site, enhancing future operational efficiency.The installation of the first bridge marks a significant milestone in conducting large-scale district-size mining exploration operations. The road will provide faster and closer access to additional awaruite zones throughout the district, allowing for year-round exploration work and drilling. Improved road access reduces the cost per meter of drilling, enabling significantly more drilling activities.Exploration Updates: Preparations are underway for the Exploration Camp with a permit in place. The camp will serve as a strategic base for on-site operations, enabling the exploration team to work efficiently in the field. To ensure year-round access to the site, road upgrades are being implemented, allowing for easy ground access regardless of the season.The exploration program is focusing on grading and prioritizing awaruite outcrops, as well as sampling and mapping prospective drill targets along the 30km trend. A LiDAR/Photos airborne program is also being planned to aid in this work, providing high-resolution topographic data and aerial imagery. The LiDAR data will help identify key geological structures, while the aerial photos will be used to visually identify outcrops for the geological team to investigate on the ground. This integrated approach will further support exploration and development efforts.Technical Advisor, Dr. Ron Britten, has completed an initial site visit and is working closely with the First Atlantic exploration team on-site. With his decades of experience, including discovering the Baptiste awaruite deposit containing over 10 billion pounds of nickel, Dr. Britten will enhance the program. Dr. Britten's efforts will help outline the best occurrences for targeting in the initial drill program planned for this year. This large-scale district sampling program can continue during the road construction phase necessary for full drilling operations. CONTINUED…Read this and more news for First Atlantic Nickelat: https://www.fanickel.com/archiveIn other market news of interest:Alaska Energy Metals Corporation (TSX-V: AEMC) (OTCQB: AKEMF) recently announced that it has begun a drilling program to test compelling geological – geophysical – geochemical targets at the Canwell block of claims that form part of its Nikolai Nickel Project in Alaska.

         "NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 28, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces it has filed a lawsuit against UiPath, Inc. (\"UiPath\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:PATH) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your UiPath investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.Investors have until August 19, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

(Nasdaq:MDB) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your MongoDB investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.Investors have until September 9, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

A copy of the lawsuit can be found here: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/CAEComplaint.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning significant cost overruns in CAE's Defense and Security (\"Defense\") segment caused by several fixed-price, long-term Defense contracts entered prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and \"re-baselin[e]\" its entire Defense business.On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts. On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $4.32 per share, or more than 16%, from $25.80 per share on August 9, 2022, to $21.48 per share on August 10, 2022.Defendants, however, continued to make false representations regarding the strength of the Defense segment.

(\"UiPath\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:PATH) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your UiPath investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.Investors have until August 19, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

(Nasdaq:MDB) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your MongoDB investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.Investors have until September 9, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

A copy of the lawsuit can be found here: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/CAEComplaint.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning significant cost overruns in CAE's Defense and Security (\"Defense\") segment caused by several fixed-price, long-term Defense contracts entered prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and \"re-baselin[e]\" its entire Defense business.On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts. On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $4.32 per share, or more than 16%, from $25.80 per share on August 9, 2022, to $21.48 per share on August 10, 2022.Defendants, however, continued to make false representations regarding the strength of the Defense segment.

The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Norbert Gamache v. CAE Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05360. A copy of the lawsuit can be found here: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/CAEComplaint.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning significant cost overruns in CAE's Defense and Security (\"Defense\") segment caused by several fixed-price, long-term Defense contracts entered prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and \"re-baselin[e]\" its entire Defense business.On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts. On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $4.32 per share, or more than 16%, from $25.80 per share on August 9, 2022, to $21.48 per share on August 10, 2022.Defendants, however, continued to make false representations regarding the strength of the Defense segment. For instance, the Company assured investors that \"[n]otwithstanding the additional volatility\" from \"acute short-term headwinds for the Defense sector, management maintains a highly positive view of its growth potential over a multi-year period.\"On November 14, 2023, CAE stated that certain legacy contracts continued to be plagued by cost overruns.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

         "NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 22, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces an investigation into Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL) and its directors and certain senior executives for breaches of their fiduciary duties by failing to stop, and/or condoning, pervasive fraud and sexual harassment at the Company.If you are a long-term holder of Globe Life, you are encouraged to submit your information at: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.Investigation Details:A recent investor report has exposed troubling allegations that Globe Life is engaged in widespread insurance fraud. The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\").BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties. BFA intends to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of Globe Life stockholders and to ensure that the fiduciaries are held accountable for the Company's pervasive violations of the law.Click here if you are a long-term holder:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.What Can You Do?If you are a current holder of Globe Life Inc. stock, you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

(Nasdaq:MDB) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your MongoDB investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.Investors have until September 9, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

(\"UiPath\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:PATH) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your UiPath investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.Investors have until August 19, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

(NYSE:GL) and its directors and certain senior executives for breaches of their fiduciary duties by failing to stop, and/or condoning, pervasive fraud and sexual harassment at the Company.If you are a long-term holder of Globe Life, you are encouraged to submit your information at: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.Investigation Details:A recent investor report has exposed troubling allegations that Globe Life is engaged in widespread insurance fraud. The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\").BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties. BFA intends to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of Globe Life stockholders and to ensure that the fiduciaries are held accountable for the Company's pervasive violations of the law.Click here if you are a long-term holder:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.What Can You Do?If you are a current holder of Globe Life Inc. stock, you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

(NYSE:TDC) securities class action lawsuit.If you invested in Teradata, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases/teradata-corp-investigation.Why is Teradata being Sued?On June 16, 2024, Teradata was sued for violations of the federal securities laws. The complaint alleges that between February 13, 2023 and February 12, 2024, Teradata and certain of its senior executives made materially false and misleading statements related to: (a) the success of the company's recently expanded business model to market products to customers beyond their IT units; (b) the robustness of the company's pipeline and ability to timely close deals; and (c) the company's revenue growth prospects.The complaint further alleges that, in reality, Teradata's expanded business model caused significant delays in the closing of large customer transactions. As a result, it is alleged that the company overstated the health of its pipeline and revenue growth prospects.Investors allegedly began to learn the truth on December 7, 2023, when Teradata revealed that certain large deals could be delayed. On this news, the price of Teradata stock declined by $2.89 per share, or 6%, to close at $43.40 per share on December 7, 2023. Then, on February 12, 2024, Teradata announced that \"deal timing issues\" caused the company to miss its previously issued ARR guidance. On this news, the price of Teradata stock declined by $10.57 per share, or 22%, to close at $38.22 per share on February 13, 2024.BFA Law encourages investors who lost money on their Teradata investment to submit your information to find out about your rights.Submit your information here:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/teradata-corp-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in Teradata Corp. you may be eligible to lead the case on behalf of shareholders.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

(Nasdaq:MDB) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your MongoDB investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.Investors have until September 9, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

It is controlled by China. Smelting is an environmentally harmful\nprocess worse than C02 that can cause environmental damage (water, air).\nTailings from sulphide minerals in mining waste have the potential to\ncreate acid. China Controls 68-80% of nickel refining smelting, and\ncontrols 84% of the Indonesia Nickel Market. A report from the Brookings\nInstitute said that: Even if the U.S. and EU were to dig more minerals out\nof the ground, many of these minerals would need to be shipped overseas for\nconcentrating, refining, and smelting without significant increases in U.S.\nand European mineral refining and smelting capacity. The U.S., in\nparticular, will likely have to update and amend its mining regulatory\nregime. Governments will also have to onshore or friend-shore smelting and\nrefining capacity. The midstream part of the equation is likely to be the\nmost challenging, complicated by high investment costs and market\nconditions. Active Companies mentioned in the article include: First\nAtlantic Nickel Corp. (OTCQB: FANCF) (TSX-V: FAN), Alaska Energy Metals\nCorporation (TSX-V: AEMC) (OTCQB: AKEMF), Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F),\nGeneral Motors Co. (NYSE: GM), TMC the metals company Inc. (NASDAQ: TMC).\n\n     The U.S. Government (USGS) sees a better way saying: The development\nof awaruite deposits in other parts of Canada may help alleviate any\nprolonged shortage of nickel concentrate. Awaruite, a natural iron-nickel\nalloy, is much easier to concentrate than pentlandite, the principal\nsulfide of nickel. Awaruite is safer and more economical to process due to\nthe magnetic separation and concentration. It uses less chemicals, less\nenergy, can be processed directly in North America and since no smelting is\nrequired doesnt need to go to China. Awaruite means no burning, which\nreleases sulfur dioxide and other toxic emissions, and less risk of acid\nmine tailings accidents or contaminations (no sulphide minerals present).\n\n     A report from Science Direct said: Nickel is an important component of\nstainless steel and a wide range of applications which are critical for the\ntransition to clean energies including electric vehicle batteries. Awaruite\nis a native nickeliron alloy that has gained interest as a possible new\neconomic source of nickel. In the last decades, there have been discoveries\nof awaruite, mostly with more significant amounts of nickel sulphides, that\nhave demonstrated the potential for awaruite to contribute to the economics\nof a deposit. This study is focused on the very large Baptiste deposit in\ncentral British Columbia, Canada where awaruite is the primary nickel\nmineral. It concluded: Awaruite has the potential to be concentrated in a\nunique and valuable nickel concentrate of distinctive characteristics\nincluding its very high nickel content, which lowers both the downstream\ncosts and the carbon intensity. Furthermore, the negligible content of\nsulphur and penalty trace elements, such as mercury, antimony, and arsenic\nin a potential awaruite concentrate, minimizes the costs of refining it.\n\n     First Atlantic Nickel Corp. (OTCQB: FANCF) (TSX-V: FAN) Hosts\nStrategic Investor Site Visit, Expands Geological Team, and Reports\nMilestones on Infrastructure Upgrades at Atlantic Nickel Project - First\nAtlantic Nickel Corp. (FSE: P21) (\"First Atlantic\" or the \"Company\") is\npleased to provide an update on the progress at its wholly-owned Atlantic\nNickel Project in central Newfoundland, Canada (the \"Project\" or the\n\"Atlantic Nickel Project\"). The Company recently completed the first site\nvisit with a strategic corporate investor (the \"Strategic Investor\"), which\nincluded examining nickel-bearing occurrences and historical drill core.\nFirst Atlantic welcomes the Strategic Investor's support, knowledge, and\nexperience in mining project exploration and development.\n\n     Highlights:\n\n//st\n\n  * First site visit at Atlantic Nickel Project with Corporate Strategic\nInvestor completed.\n  * Awaruite identified as visible grains in previous drill core from\nAtlantic Lake Area.\n  * First bridge installed as part of road upgrade and development program,\nenabling year-round Project access.\n  * Technical Advisor, Dr. Ron Britten has conducted a site visit to\nexamine awaruite nickel occurrences and will help lead the charge to\ndiscover a potential large scale deposit.\n  * Permits filed for phase 2 of new all-weather road construction.\n  * Geological team with awaruite experience expanded to accelerate\ndistrict-scale exploration efforts along extensive 30 km trend.\n\n//et\n\n     Project Road Update: First Atlantic is also pleased to announce the\ninstallation of the first bridge as part of its infrastructure upgrade\nprogram on the Project. The Company anticipates the completion of two\nadditional bridges, allowing for the establishment of operations directly\non the Project site, enhancing future operational efficiency.\n\n     The installation of the first bridge marks a significant milestone in\nconducting large-scale district-size mining exploration operations. The\nroad will provide faster and closer access to additional awaruite zones\nthroughout the district, allowing for year-round exploration work and\ndrilling. Improved road access reduces the cost per meter of drilling,\nenabling significantly more drilling activities.\n\n     Exploration Updates: Preparations are underway for the Exploration\nCamp with a permit in place. The camp will serve as a strategic base for\non-site operations, enabling the exploration team to work efficiently in\nthe field. To ensure year-round access to the site, road upgrades are being\nimplemented, allowing for easy ground access regardless of the season.\n\n     The exploration program is focusing on grading and prioritizing\nawaruite outcrops, as well as sampling and mapping prospective drill\ntargets along the 30km trend. A LiDAR/Photos airborne program is also being\nplanned to aid in this work, providing high-resolution topographic data and\naerial imagery. The LiDAR data will help identify key geological\nstructures, while the aerial photos will be used to visually identify\noutcrops for the geological team to investigate on the ground. This\nintegrated approach will further support exploration and development\nefforts.\n\n     Technical Advisor, Dr. Ron Britten, has completed an initial site\nvisit and is working closely with the First Atlantic exploration team\non-site. With his decades of experience, including discovering the Baptiste\nawaruite deposit containing over 10 billion pounds of nickel, Dr. Britten\nwill enhance the program. Dr. Britten's efforts will help outline the best\noccurrences for targeting in the initial drill program planned for this\nyear. This large-scale district sampling program can continue during the\nroad construction phase necessary for full drilling operations.

         "PALM BEACH, Fla., July  29, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FinancialNewsMedia.com News Commentary - The refining of sulfide nickel deposits usually requires a smelting capacity not present today in North America. It is controlled by China. Smelting is an environmentally harmful process worse than C02 that can cause environmental damage (water, air). Tailings from sulphide minerals in mining waste have the potential to create acid. China Controls 68-80% of nickel refining smelting, and controls 84% of the Indonesia Nickel Market. A report from the Brookings Institute said that: “Even if the U.S. and EU were to dig more minerals out of the ground, many of these minerals would need to be shipped overseas for concentrating, refining, and smelting without significant increases in U.S. and European mineral refining and smelting capacity. The U.S., in particular, will likely have to update and amend its mining regulatory regime. Governments will also have to onshore or “friend-shore” smelting and refining capacity. The midstream part of the equation is likely to be the most challenging, complicated by high investment costs and market conditions.” Active Companies mentioned in the article include: First Atlantic Nickel Corp. (OTCQB: FANCF) (TSX-V: FAN), Alaska Energy Metals Corporation (TSX-V: AEMC) (OTCQB: AKEMF), Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F), General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM), TMC the metals company Inc. (NASDAQ: TMC).The U.S. Government (USGS) sees a better way saying: “The development of awaruite deposits in other parts of Canada may help alleviate any prolonged shortage of nickel concentrate. Awaruite, a natural iron-nickel alloy, is much easier to concentrate than pentlandite, the principal sulfide of nickel. Awaruite is safer and more economical to process due to the magnetic separation and concentration. It uses less chemicals, less energy, can be processed directly in North America and since no smelting is required doesn’t need to go to China. Awaruite means no burning, which releases sulfur dioxide and other toxic emissions, and less risk of acid mine tailings accidents or contaminations (no sulphide minerals present).”A report from Science Direct said: “Nickel is an important component of stainless steel and a wide range of applications which are critical for the transition to clean energies including electric vehicle batteries. Awaruite is a native nickel–iron alloy that has gained interest as a possible new economic source of nickel. In the last decades, there have been discoveries of awaruite, mostly with more significant amounts of nickel sulphides, that have demonstrated the potential for awaruite to contribute to the economics of a deposit. This study is focused on the very large Baptiste deposit in central British Columbia, Canada where awaruite is the primary nickel mineral.” It concluded: “Awaruite has the potential to be concentrated in a unique and valuable nickel concentrate of distinctive characteristics including its very high nickel content, which lowers both the downstream costs and the carbon intensity. Furthermore, the negligible content of sulphur and penalty trace elements, such as mercury, antimony, and arsenic in a potential awaruite concentrate, minimizes the costs of refining it.”First Atlantic Nickel Corp. (OTCQB: FANCF) (TSX-V: FAN) Hosts Strategic Investor Site Visit, Expands Geological Team, and Reports Milestones on Infrastructure Upgrades at Atlantic Nickel Project - First Atlantic Nickel Corp. (FSE: P21) (\"First Atlantic\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to provide an update on the progress at its wholly-owned Atlantic Nickel Project in central Newfoundland, Canada (the \"Project\" or the \"Atlantic Nickel Project\"). The Company recently completed the first site visit with a strategic corporate investor (the \"Strategic Investor\"), which included examining nickel-bearing occurrences and historical drill core. First Atlantic welcomes the Strategic Investor's support, knowledge, and experience in mining project exploration and development.Highlights:First site visit at Atlantic Nickel Project with Corporate Strategic Investor completed.Awaruite identified as visible grains in previous drill core from Atlantic Lake Area.First bridge installed as part of road upgrade and development program, enabling year-round Project access.Technical Advisor, Dr. Ron Britten has conducted a site visit to examine awaruite nickel occurrences and will help lead the charge to discover a potential large scale deposit.Permits filed for phase 2 of new all-weather road construction.Geological team with awaruite experience expanded to accelerate district-scale exploration efforts along extensive 30 km trend.Project Road Update: First Atlantic is also pleased to announce the installation of the first bridge as part of its infrastructure upgrade program on the Project. The Company anticipates the completion of two additional bridges, allowing for the establishment of operations directly on the Project site, enhancing future operational efficiency.The installation of the first bridge marks a significant milestone in conducting large-scale district-size mining exploration operations. The road will provide faster and closer access to additional awaruite zones throughout the district, allowing for year-round exploration work and drilling. Improved road access reduces the cost per meter of drilling, enabling significantly more drilling activities.Exploration Updates: Preparations are underway for the Exploration Camp with a permit in place. The camp will serve as a strategic base for on-site operations, enabling the exploration team to work efficiently in the field. To ensure year-round access to the site, road upgrades are being implemented, allowing for easy ground access regardless of the season.The exploration program is focusing on grading and prioritizing awaruite outcrops, as well as sampling and mapping prospective drill targets along the 30km trend. A LiDAR/Photos airborne program is also being planned to aid in this work, providing high-resolution topographic data and aerial imagery. The LiDAR data will help identify key geological structures, while the aerial photos will be used to visually identify outcrops for the geological team to investigate on the ground. This integrated approach will further support exploration and development efforts.Technical Advisor, Dr. Ron Britten, has completed an initial site visit and is working closely with the First Atlantic exploration team on-site. With his decades of experience, including discovering the Baptiste awaruite deposit containing over 10 billion pounds of nickel, Dr. Britten will enhance the program. Dr. Britten's efforts will help outline the best occurrences for targeting in the initial drill program planned for this year. This large-scale district sampling program can continue during the road construction phase necessary for full drilling operations. CONTINUED…Read this and more news for First Atlantic Nickelat: https://www.fanickel.com/archiveIn other market news of interest:Alaska Energy Metals Corporation (TSX-V: AEMC) (OTCQB: AKEMF) recently announced that it has begun a drilling program to test compelling geological – geophysical – geochemical targets at the Canwell block of claims that form part of its Nikolai Nickel Project in Alaska.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

         "NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 28, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces a lawsuit has been filed against MongoDB, Inc. (Nasdaq:MDB) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your MongoDB investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.Investors have until September 9, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Norbert Gamache v. CAE Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05360. A copy of the lawsuit can be found here: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/CAEComplaint.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning significant cost overruns in CAE's Defense and Security (\"Defense\") segment caused by several fixed-price, long-term Defense contracts entered prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and \"re-baselin[e]\" its entire Defense business.On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts. On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $4.32 per share, or more than 16%, from $25.80 per share on August 9, 2022, to $21.48 per share on August 10, 2022.Defendants, however, continued to make false representations regarding the strength of the Defense segment.

(\"UiPath\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:PATH) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your UiPath investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.Investors have until August 19, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

A copy of the lawsuit can be found here: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/CAEComplaint.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning significant cost overruns in CAE's Defense and Security (\"Defense\") segment caused by several fixed-price, long-term Defense contracts entered prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and \"re-baselin[e]\" its entire Defense business.On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts.

(\"CAE\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:CAE) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered a loss on your CAE investment, please submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases/cae-inc-investigation.The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in CAE who purchased or acquired CAE stock on an exchange in the United States between February 11, 2022 and May 21, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Norbert Gamache v. CAE Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05360. A copy of the lawsuit can be found here: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/CAEComplaint.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning significant cost overruns in CAE's Defense and Security (\"Defense\") segment caused by several fixed-price, long-term Defense contracts entered prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and \"re-baselin[e]\" its entire Defense business.On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts. On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $4.32 per share, or more than 16%, from $25.80 per share on August 9, 2022, to $21.48 per share on August 10, 2022.Defendants, however, continued to make false representations regarding the strength of the Defense segment. For instance, the Company assured investors that \"[n]otwithstanding the additional volatility\" from \"acute short-term headwinds for the Defense sector, management maintains a highly positive view of its growth potential over a multi-year period.\"On November 14, 2023, CAE stated that certain legacy contracts continued to be plagued by cost overruns.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

(NYSE:GL) and its directors and certain senior executives for breaches of their fiduciary duties by failing to stop, and/or condoning, pervasive fraud and sexual harassment at the Company.If you are a long-term holder of Globe Life, you are encouraged to submit your information at: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.Investigation Details:A recent investor report has exposed troubling allegations that Globe Life is engaged in widespread insurance fraud. The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\").BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties. BFA intends to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of Globe Life stockholders and to ensure that the fiduciaries are held accountable for the Company's pervasive violations of the law.Click here if you are a long-term holder:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.What Can You Do?If you are a current holder of Globe Life Inc. stock, you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

         "NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 22, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces a lawsuit has been filed against MongoDB, Inc. (Nasdaq:MDB) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your MongoDB investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.Investors have until September 9, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

(\"UiPath\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:PATH) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your UiPath investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.Investors have until August 19, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

(NYSE:GL) and its directors and certain senior executives for breaches of their fiduciary duties by failing to stop, and/or condoning, pervasive fraud and sexual harassment at the Company.If you are a long-term holder of Globe Life, you are encouraged to submit your information at: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.Investigation Details:A recent investor report has exposed troubling allegations that Globe Life is engaged in widespread insurance fraud. The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\").BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties. BFA intends to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of Globe Life stockholders and to ensure that the fiduciaries are held accountable for the Company's pervasive violations of the law.Click here if you are a long-term holder:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.What Can You Do?If you are a current holder of Globe Life Inc. stock, you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

         "NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 19, 2024 / Top law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces the upcoming August 13, 2024 deadline in the Teradata Corp. (NYSE:TDC) securities class action lawsuit.If you invested in Teradata, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases/teradata-corp-investigation.Why is Teradata being Sued?On June 16, 2024, Teradata was sued for violations of the federal securities laws. The complaint alleges that between February 13, 2023 and February 12, 2024, Teradata and certain of its senior executives made materially false and misleading statements related to: (a) the success of the company's recently expanded business model to market products to customers beyond their IT units; (b) the robustness of the company's pipeline and ability to timely close deals; and (c) the company's revenue growth prospects.The complaint further alleges that, in reality, Teradata's expanded business model caused significant delays in the closing of large customer transactions. As a result, it is alleged that the company overstated the health of its pipeline and revenue growth prospects.Investors allegedly began to learn the truth on December 7, 2023, when Teradata revealed that certain large deals could be delayed. On this news, the price of Teradata stock declined by $2.89 per share, or 6%, to close at $43.40 per share on December 7, 2023. Then, on February 12, 2024, Teradata announced that \"deal timing issues\" caused the company to miss its previously issued ARR guidance. On this news, the price of Teradata stock declined by $10.57 per share, or 22%, to close at $38.22 per share on February 13, 2024.BFA Law encourages investors who lost money on their Teradata investment to submit your information to find out about your rights.Submit your information here:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/teradata-corp-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in Teradata Corp. you may be eligible to lead the case on behalf of shareholders.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

(Nasdaq:MDB) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your MongoDB investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.Investors have until September 9, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

(NYSE:GL) and its directors and certain senior executives for breaches of their fiduciary duties by failing to stop, and/or condoning, pervasive fraud and sexual harassment at the Company.If you are a long-term holder of Globe Life, you are encouraged to submit your information at: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.Investigation Details:A recent investor report has exposed troubling allegations that Globe Life is engaged in widespread insurance fraud. The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\").BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties. BFA intends to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of Globe Life stockholders and to ensure that the fiduciaries are held accountable for the Company's pervasive violations of the law.Click here if you are a long-term holder:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.What Can You Do?If you are a current holder of Globe Life Inc. stock, you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

It is controlled by China. Smelting is an environmentally harmful\nprocess worse than C02 that can cause environmental damage (water, air).\nTailings from sulphide minerals in mining waste have the potential to\ncreate acid. China Controls 68-80% of nickel refining smelting, and\ncontrols 84% of the Indonesia Nickel Market. A report from the Brookings\nInstitute said that: Even if the U.S. and EU were to dig more minerals out\nof the ground, many of these minerals would need to be shipped overseas for\nconcentrating, refining, and smelting without significant increases in U.S.\nand European mineral refining and smelting capacity. The U.S., in\nparticular, will likely have to update and amend its mining regulatory\nregime. Governments will also have to onshore or friend-shore smelting and\nrefining capacity. The midstream part of the equation is likely to be the\nmost challenging, complicated by high investment costs and market\nconditions. Active Companies mentioned in the article include: First\nAtlantic Nickel Corp. (OTCQB: FANCF) (TSX-V: FAN), Alaska Energy Metals\nCorporation (TSX-V: AEMC) (OTCQB: AKEMF), Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F),\nGeneral Motors Co. (NYSE: GM), TMC the metals company Inc. (NASDAQ: TMC).\n\n     The U.S. Government (USGS) sees a better way saying: The development\nof awaruite deposits in other parts of Canada may help alleviate any\nprolonged shortage of nickel concentrate. Awaruite, a natural iron-nickel\nalloy, is much easier to concentrate than pentlandite, the principal\nsulfide of nickel. Awaruite is safer and more economical to process due to\nthe magnetic separation and concentration. It uses less chemicals, less\nenergy, can be processed directly in North America and since no smelting is\nrequired doesnt need to go to China. Awaruite means no burning, which\nreleases sulfur dioxide and other toxic emissions, and less risk of acid\nmine tailings accidents or contaminations (no sulphide minerals present).\n\n     A report from Science Direct said: Nickel is an important component of\nstainless steel and a wide range of applications which are critical for the\ntransition to clean energies including electric vehicle batteries. Awaruite\nis a native nickeliron alloy that has gained interest as a possible new\neconomic source of nickel. In the last decades, there have been discoveries\nof awaruite, mostly with more significant amounts of nickel sulphides, that\nhave demonstrated the potential for awaruite to contribute to the economics\nof a deposit. This study is focused on the very large Baptiste deposit in\ncentral British Columbia, Canada where awaruite is the primary nickel\nmineral. It concluded: Awaruite has the potential to be concentrated in a\nunique and valuable nickel concentrate of distinctive characteristics\nincluding its very high nickel content, which lowers both the downstream\ncosts and the carbon intensity. Furthermore, the negligible content of\nsulphur and penalty trace elements, such as mercury, antimony, and arsenic\nin a potential awaruite concentrate, minimizes the costs of refining it.\n\n     First Atlantic Nickel Corp. (OTCQB: FANCF) (TSX-V: FAN) Hosts\nStrategic Investor Site Visit, Expands Geological Team, and Reports\nMilestones on Infrastructure Upgrades at Atlantic Nickel Project - First\nAtlantic Nickel Corp. (FSE: P21) (\"First Atlantic\" or the \"Company\") is\npleased to provide an update on the progress at its wholly-owned Atlantic\nNickel Project in central Newfoundland, Canada (the \"Project\" or the\n\"Atlantic Nickel Project\"). The Company recently completed the first site\nvisit with a strategic corporate investor (the \"Strategic Investor\"), which\nincluded examining nickel-bearing occurrences and historical drill core.\nFirst Atlantic welcomes the Strategic Investor's support, knowledge, and\nexperience in mining project exploration and development.\n\n     Highlights:\n\n//st\n\n  * First site visit at Atlantic Nickel Project with Corporate Strategic\nInvestor completed.\n  * Awaruite identified as visible grains in previous drill core from\nAtlantic Lake Area.\n  * First bridge installed as part of road upgrade and development program,\nenabling year-round Project access.\n  * Technical Advisor, Dr. Ron Britten has conducted a site visit to\nexamine awaruite nickel occurrences and will help lead the charge to\ndiscover a potential large scale deposit.\n  * Permits filed for phase 2 of new all-weather road construction.\n  * Geological team with awaruite experience expanded to accelerate\ndistrict-scale exploration efforts along extensive 30 km trend.\n\n//et\n\n     Project Road Update: First Atlantic is also pleased to announce the\ninstallation of the first bridge as part of its infrastructure upgrade\nprogram on the Project. The Company anticipates the completion of two\nadditional bridges, allowing for the establishment of operations directly\non the Project site, enhancing future operational efficiency.\n\n     The installation of the first bridge marks a significant milestone in\nconducting large-scale district-size mining exploration operations. The\nroad will provide faster and closer access to additional awaruite zones\nthroughout the district, allowing for year-round exploration work and\ndrilling. Improved road access reduces the cost per meter of drilling,\nenabling significantly more drilling activities.\n\n     Exploration Updates: Preparations are underway for the Exploration\nCamp with a permit in place. The camp will serve as a strategic base for\non-site operations, enabling the exploration team to work efficiently in\nthe field. To ensure year-round access to the site, road upgrades are being\nimplemented, allowing for easy ground access regardless of the season.\n\n     The exploration program is focusing on grading and prioritizing\nawaruite outcrops, as well as sampling and mapping prospective drill\ntargets along the 30km trend. A LiDAR/Photos airborne program is also being\nplanned to aid in this work, providing high-resolution topographic data and\naerial imagery. The LiDAR data will help identify key geological\nstructures, while the aerial photos will be used to visually identify\noutcrops for the geological team to investigate on the ground. This\nintegrated approach will further support exploration and development\nefforts.\n\n     Technical Advisor, Dr. Ron Britten, has completed an initial site\nvisit and is working closely with the First Atlantic exploration team\non-site. With his decades of experience, including discovering the Baptiste\nawaruite deposit containing over 10 billion pounds of nickel, Dr. Britten\nwill enhance the program. Dr. Britten's efforts will help outline the best\noccurrences for targeting in the initial drill program planned for this\nyear. This large-scale district sampling program can continue during the\nroad construction phase necessary for full drilling operations.

The LiDAR data will help identify key geological structures, while the aerial photos will be used to visually identify outcrops for the geological team to investigate on the ground. This integrated approach will further support exploration and development efforts.Technical Advisor, Dr. Ron Britten, has completed an initial site visit and is working closely with the First Atlantic exploration team on-site. With his decades of experience, including discovering the Baptiste awaruite deposit containing over 10 billion pounds of nickel, Dr. Britten will enhance the program. Dr. Britten's efforts will help outline the best occurrences for targeting in the initial drill program planned for this year. This large-scale district sampling program can continue during the road construction phase necessary for full drilling operations. CONTINUED…Read this and more news for First Atlantic Nickelat: https://www.fanickel.com/archiveIn other market news of interest:Alaska Energy Metals Corporation (TSX-V: AEMC) (OTCQB: AKEMF) recently announced that it has begun a drilling program to test compelling geological – geophysical – geochemical targets at the Canwell block of claims that form part of its Nikolai Nickel Project in Alaska.

(NASDAQ: TMC), an explorer of the world’s largest estimated undeveloped source of critical battery metals, recently announced that it has successfully produced the world’s first cobalt sulfate derived exclusively from seafloor polymetallic nodules. The cobalt sulfate was generated during bench-scale testing of TMC’s hydrometallurgical flowsheet design with SGS Canada Inc. (“SGS”). The test work was carried out at SGS’ Metallurgical Centre of Excellence testing facility in Lakefield, Ontario.Based on samples of nickel-cobalt-copper matte first produced by TMC in 2021, the Extractive Metallurgy team at SGS tested TMC’s efficient flowsheet to process high-grade nickel-copper-cobalt matte directly to high-purity cobalt sulfate without making cobalt metal, while producing fertilizer byproducts instead of solid waste or tailings. This milestone follows last month’s successful production of nickel sulfate, a key raw material input used in the production of energy-dense electric vehicle batteries.About FN Media Group:At FN Media Group, via our top-rated online news portal at www.financialnewsmedia.com, we are one of the very few select firms providing top tier one syndicated news distribution, targeted ticker tag press releases and stock market news coverage for today’s emerging companies. #pressreleases #tickertagpressreleasesFollow us on Facebook to receive emerging news updates:https://www.facebook.com/financialnewsmediaFollow us on Twitter for real time Breaking News:https://twitter.com/FNMgroupFollow us on LinkedIn:https://www.linkedin.com/in/financialnewsmedia/DISCLAIMER: FN Media Group LLC (FNM), which owns and operates FinancialNewsMedia.com and MarketNewsUpdates.com, is a third party publisher and news dissemination service provider, which disseminates electronic information through multiple online media channels.

(\"UiPath\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:PATH) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your UiPath investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.Investors have until August 19, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

(Nasdaq:MDB) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your MongoDB investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.Investors have until September 9, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

         "NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 28, 2024 / Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP (\"BFA\") announces that it has filed a class action lawsuit for violations of the federal securities laws against CAE Inc. (\"CAE\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:CAE) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered a loss on your CAE investment, please submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases/cae-inc-investigation.The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in CAE who purchased or acquired CAE stock on an exchange in the United States between February 11, 2022 and May 21, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Norbert Gamache v. CAE Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05360. A copy of the lawsuit can be found here: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/CAEComplaint.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning significant cost overruns in CAE's Defense and Security (\"Defense\") segment caused by several fixed-price, long-term Defense contracts entered prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and \"re-baselin[e]\" its entire Defense business.On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts. On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $4.32 per share, or more than 16%, from $25.80 per share on August 9, 2022, to $21.48 per share on August 10, 2022.Defendants, however, continued to make false representations regarding the strength of the Defense segment. For instance, the Company assured investors that \"[n]otwithstanding the additional volatility\" from \"acute short-term headwinds for the Defense sector, management maintains a highly positive view of its growth potential over a multi-year period.\"On November 14, 2023, CAE stated that certain legacy contracts continued to be plagued by cost overruns. CAE revealed that, within the Defense segment, the Company planned to \"retir[e] legacy contracts, which have been most affected by inflationary pressures.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $0.85 per share, or nearly 4%, from $21.92 per share on November 13, 2023, to $21.07 per share on November 14, 2023.Three months later, on February 14, 2024, CAE announced that it \"sought to further accelerate the retirement of outstanding program risks, mainly associated with certain legacy Defense contracts that we entered into pre-COVID and have been most impacted by economic headwinds.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $2.01 per share, or nearly 10%, from $20.92 per share on February 13, 2024, to $18.91 per share on February 14, 2024.Finally, after the close of trading on May 21, 2024, CAE announced a \"re-baselining of its Defense business, Defense impairments, [and] accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts.\" The Company stated that \"CAE has recorded a $568.0 million non-cash impairment of Defense goodwill,\" \"$90.3 million in unfavorable Defense contract profit adjustments as a result of accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts,\" and a \"$35.7 million impairment of related technology and other non-financial assets which are principally related to the Legacy Contracts.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $1.03 per share, or more than 5%, from $19.83 per share on May 21, 2024, to $18.80 per share on May 22, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/cae-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in CAE, Inc. you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

         "NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 25, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces it has filed a lawsuit against UiPath, Inc. (\"UiPath\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:PATH) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your UiPath investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.Investors have until August 19, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million.

         "NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 25, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces a lawsuit has been filed against MongoDB, Inc. (Nasdaq:MDB) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your MongoDB investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.Investors have until September 9, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

         "NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 24, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces it has filed a lawsuit against UiPath, Inc. (\"UiPath\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:PATH) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your UiPath investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.Investors have until August 19, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

A copy of the lawsuit can be found here: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/CAEComplaint.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning significant cost overruns in CAE's Defense and Security (\"Defense\") segment caused by several fixed-price, long-term Defense contracts entered prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and \"re-baselin[e]\" its entire Defense business.On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts.

(NYSE:GL) and its directors and certain senior executives for breaches of their fiduciary duties by failing to stop, and/or condoning, pervasive fraud and sexual harassment at the Company.If you are a long-term holder of Globe Life, you are encouraged to submit your information at: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.Investigation Details:A recent investor report has exposed troubling allegations that Globe Life is engaged in widespread insurance fraud. The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\").BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties. BFA intends to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of Globe Life stockholders and to ensure that the fiduciaries are held accountable for the Company's pervasive violations of the law.Click here if you are a long-term holder:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.What Can You Do?If you are a current holder of Globe Life Inc. stock, you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading.

The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin.

(NYSE:GL) and its directors and certain senior executives for breaches of their fiduciary duties by failing to stop, and/or condoning, pervasive fraud and sexual harassment at the Company.If you are a long-term holder of Globe Life, you are encouraged to submit your information at: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.Investigation Details:A recent investor report has exposed troubling allegations that Globe Life is engaged in widespread insurance fraud. The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\").BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties. BFA intends to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of Globe Life stockholders and to ensure that the fiduciaries are held accountable for the Company's pervasive violations of the law.Click here if you are a long-term holder:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.What Can You Do?If you are a current holder of Globe Life Inc. stock, you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

         "NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 19, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces a lawsuit has been filed against MongoDB, Inc. (Nasdaq:MDB) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your MongoDB investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.Investors have until September 9, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

         "NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 19, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces an investigation into Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL) and its directors and certain senior executives for breaches of their fiduciary duties by failing to stop, and/or condoning, pervasive fraud and sexual harassment at the Company.If you are a long-term holder of Globe Life, you are encouraged to submit your information at: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.Investigation Details:A recent investor report has exposed troubling allegations that Globe Life is engaged in widespread insurance fraud. The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\").BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties. BFA intends to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of Globe Life stockholders and to ensure that the fiduciaries are held accountable for the Company's pervasive violations of the law.Click here if you are a long-term holder:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.What Can You Do?If you are a current holder of Globe Life Inc. stock, you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

It is controlled by China. Smelting is an environmentally harmful\nprocess worse than C02 that can cause environmental damage (water, air).\nTailings from sulphide minerals in mining waste have the potential to\ncreate acid. China Controls 68-80% of nickel refining smelting, and\ncontrols 84% of the Indonesia Nickel Market. A report from the Brookings\nInstitute said that: Even if the U.S. and EU were to dig more minerals out\nof the ground, many of these minerals would need to be shipped overseas for\nconcentrating, refining, and smelting without significant increases in U.S.\nand European mineral refining and smelting capacity. The U.S., in\nparticular, will likely have to update and amend its mining regulatory\nregime. Governments will also have to onshore or friend-shore smelting and\nrefining capacity. The midstream part of the equation is likely to be the\nmost challenging, complicated by high investment costs and market\nconditions. Active Companies mentioned in the article include: First\nAtlantic Nickel Corp. (OTCQB: FANCF) (TSX-V: FAN), Alaska Energy Metals\nCorporation (TSX-V: AEMC) (OTCQB: AKEMF), Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F),\nGeneral Motors Co. (NYSE: GM), TMC the metals company Inc. (NASDAQ: TMC).\n\n     The U.S. Government (USGS) sees a better way saying: The development\nof awaruite deposits in other parts of Canada may help alleviate any\nprolonged shortage of nickel concentrate. Awaruite, a natural iron-nickel\nalloy, is much easier to concentrate than pentlandite, the principal\nsulfide of nickel. Awaruite is safer and more economical to process due to\nthe magnetic separation and concentration. It uses less chemicals, less\nenergy, can be processed directly in North America and since no smelting is\nrequired doesnt need to go to China. Awaruite means no burning, which\nreleases sulfur dioxide and other toxic emissions, and less risk of acid\nmine tailings accidents or contaminations (no sulphide minerals present).\n\n     A report from Science Direct said: Nickel is an important component of\nstainless steel and a wide range of applications which are critical for the\ntransition to clean energies including electric vehicle batteries. Awaruite\nis a native nickeliron alloy that has gained interest as a possible new\neconomic source of nickel. In the last decades, there have been discoveries\nof awaruite, mostly with more significant amounts of nickel sulphides, that\nhave demonstrated the potential for awaruite to contribute to the economics\nof a deposit. This study is focused on the very large Baptiste deposit in\ncentral British Columbia, Canada where awaruite is the primary nickel\nmineral. It concluded: Awaruite has the potential to be concentrated in a\nunique and valuable nickel concentrate of distinctive characteristics\nincluding its very high nickel content, which lowers both the downstream\ncosts and the carbon intensity. Furthermore, the negligible content of\nsulphur and penalty trace elements, such as mercury, antimony, and arsenic\nin a potential awaruite concentrate, minimizes the costs of refining it.\n\n     First Atlantic Nickel Corp. (OTCQB: FANCF) (TSX-V: FAN) Hosts\nStrategic Investor Site Visit, Expands Geological Team, and Reports\nMilestones on Infrastructure Upgrades at Atlantic Nickel Project - First\nAtlantic Nickel Corp. (FSE: P21) (\"First Atlantic\" or the \"Company\") is\npleased to provide an update on the progress at its wholly-owned Atlantic\nNickel Project in central Newfoundland, Canada (the \"Project\" or the\n\"Atlantic Nickel Project\"). The Company recently completed the first site\nvisit with a strategic corporate investor (the \"Strategic Investor\"), which\nincluded examining nickel-bearing occurrences and historical drill core.\nFirst Atlantic welcomes the Strategic Investor's support, knowledge, and\nexperience in mining project exploration and development.\n\n     Highlights:\n\n//st\n\n  * First site visit at Atlantic Nickel Project with Corporate Strategic\nInvestor completed.\n  * Awaruite identified as visible grains in previous drill core from\nAtlantic Lake Area.\n  * First bridge installed as part of road upgrade and development program,\nenabling year-round Project access.\n  * Technical Advisor, Dr. Ron Britten has conducted a site visit to\nexamine awaruite nickel occurrences and will help lead the charge to\ndiscover a potential large scale deposit.\n  * Permits filed for phase 2 of new all-weather road construction.\n  * Geological team with awaruite experience expanded to accelerate\ndistrict-scale exploration efforts along extensive 30 km trend.\n\n//et\n\n     Project Road Update: First Atlantic is also pleased to announce the\ninstallation of the first bridge as part of its infrastructure upgrade\nprogram on the Project. The Company anticipates the completion of two\nadditional bridges, allowing for the establishment of operations directly\non the Project site, enhancing future operational efficiency.\n\n     The installation of the first bridge marks a significant milestone in\nconducting large-scale district-size mining exploration operations. The\nroad will provide faster and closer access to additional awaruite zones\nthroughout the district, allowing for year-round exploration work and\ndrilling. Improved road access reduces the cost per meter of drilling,\nenabling significantly more drilling activities.\n\n     Exploration Updates: Preparations are underway for the Exploration\nCamp with a permit in place. The camp will serve as a strategic base for\non-site operations, enabling the exploration team to work efficiently in\nthe field. To ensure year-round access to the site, road upgrades are being\nimplemented, allowing for easy ground access regardless of the season.\n\n     The exploration program is focusing on grading and prioritizing\nawaruite outcrops, as well as sampling and mapping prospective drill\ntargets along the 30km trend. A LiDAR/Photos airborne program is also being\nplanned to aid in this work, providing high-resolution topographic data and\naerial imagery. The LiDAR data will help identify key geological\nstructures, while the aerial photos will be used to visually identify\noutcrops for the geological team to investigate on the ground. This\nintegrated approach will further support exploration and development\nefforts.\n\n     Technical Advisor, Dr. Ron Britten, has completed an initial site\nvisit and is working closely with the First Atlantic exploration team\non-site. With his decades of experience, including discovering the Baptiste\nawaruite deposit containing over 10 billion pounds of nickel, Dr. Britten\nwill enhance the program. Dr. Britten's efforts will help outline the best\noccurrences for targeting in the initial drill program planned for this\nyear. This large-scale district sampling program can continue during the\nroad construction phase necessary for full drilling operations.

(\"UiPath\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:PATH) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your UiPath investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.Investors have until August 19, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

(NYSE:TDC) securities class action lawsuit.If you invested in Teradata, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases/teradata-corp-investigation.Why is Teradata being Sued?On June 16, 2024, Teradata was sued for violations of the federal securities laws. The complaint alleges that between February 13, 2023 and February 12, 2024, Teradata and certain of its senior executives made materially false and misleading statements related to: (a) the success of the company's recently expanded business model to market products to customers beyond their IT units; (b) the robustness of the company's pipeline and ability to timely close deals; and (c) the company's revenue growth prospects.The complaint further alleges that, in reality, Teradata's expanded business model caused significant delays in the closing of large customer transactions. As a result, it is alleged that the company overstated the health of its pipeline and revenue growth prospects.Investors allegedly began to learn the truth on December 7, 2023, when Teradata revealed that certain large deals could be delayed. On this news, the price of Teradata stock declined by $2.89 per share, or 6%, to close at $43.40 per share on December 7, 2023.

(Nasdaq:MDB) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your MongoDB investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.Investors have until September 9, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

A copy of the lawsuit can be found here: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/CAEComplaint.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning significant cost overruns in CAE's Defense and Security (\"Defense\") segment caused by several fixed-price, long-term Defense contracts entered prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and \"re-baselin[e]\" its entire Defense business.On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts. On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $4.32 per share, or more than 16%, from $25.80 per share on August 9, 2022, to $21.48 per share on August 10, 2022.Defendants, however, continued to make false representations regarding the strength of the Defense segment. For instance, the Company assured investors that \"[n]otwithstanding the additional volatility\" from \"acute short-term headwinds for the Defense sector, management maintains a highly positive view of its growth potential over a multi-year period.\"On November 14, 2023, CAE stated that certain legacy contracts continued to be plagued by cost overruns.

(\"UiPath\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:PATH) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your UiPath investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.Investors have until August 19, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

(Nasdaq:MDB) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your MongoDB investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.Investors have until September 9, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

(NASDAQ:MDB) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your MongoDB investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.Investors have until September 9, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

(\"CAE\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:CAE) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered a loss on your CAE investment, please submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases/cae-inc-investigation.The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in CAE who purchased or acquired CAE stock on an exchange in the United States between February 11, 2022 and May 21, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Norbert Gamache v. CAE Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05360. A copy of the lawsuit can be found here: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/CAEComplaint.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning significant cost overruns in CAE's Defense and Security (\"Defense\") segment caused by several fixed-price, long-term Defense contracts entered prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and \"re-baselin[e]\" its entire Defense business.On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts. On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $4.32 per share, or more than 16%, from $25.80 per share on August 9, 2022, to $21.48 per share on August 10, 2022.Defendants, however, continued to make false representations regarding the strength of the Defense segment. For instance, the Company assured investors that \"[n]otwithstanding the additional volatility\" from \"acute short-term headwinds for the Defense sector, management maintains a highly positive view of its growth potential over a multi-year period.\"On November 14, 2023, CAE stated that certain legacy contracts continued to be plagued by cost overruns. CAE revealed that, within the Defense segment, the Company planned to \"retir[e] legacy contracts, which have been most affected by inflationary pressures.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $0.85 per share, or nearly 4%, from $21.92 per share on November 13, 2023, to $21.07 per share on November 14, 2023.Three months later, on February 14, 2024, CAE announced that it \"sought to further accelerate the retirement of outstanding program risks, mainly associated with certain legacy Defense contracts that we entered into pre-COVID and have been most impacted by economic headwinds.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $2.01 per share, or nearly 10%, from $20.92 per share on February 13, 2024, to $18.91 per share on February 14, 2024.Finally, after the close of trading on May 21, 2024, CAE announced a \"re-baselining of its Defense business, Defense impairments, [and] accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts.\" The Company stated that \"CAE has recorded a $568.0 million non-cash impairment of Defense goodwill,\" \"$90.3 million in unfavorable Defense contract profit adjustments as a result of accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts,\" and a \"$35.7 million impairment of related technology and other non-financial assets which are principally related to the Legacy Contracts.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $1.03 per share, or more than 5%, from $19.83 per share on May 21, 2024, to $18.80 per share on May 22, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/cae-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in CAE, Inc. you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

(NYSE:GL) and its directors and certain senior executives for breaches of their fiduciary duties by failing to stop, and/or condoning, pervasive fraud and sexual harassment at the Company.If you are a long-term holder of Globe Life, you are encouraged to submit your information at: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.Investigation Details:A recent investor report has exposed troubling allegations that Globe Life is engaged in widespread insurance fraud. The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\").BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties. BFA intends to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of Globe Life stockholders and to ensure that the fiduciaries are held accountable for the Company's pervasive violations of the law.Click here if you are a long-term holder:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.What Can You Do?If you are a current holder of Globe Life Inc. stock, you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v.

The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

(\"UiPath\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:PATH) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your UiPath investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.Investors have until August 19, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

(NYSE:GL) and its directors and certain senior executives for breaches of their fiduciary duties by failing to stop, and/or condoning, pervasive fraud and sexual harassment at the Company.If you are a long-term holder of Globe Life, you are encouraged to submit your information at: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.Investigation Details:A recent investor report has exposed troubling allegations that Globe Life is engaged in widespread insurance fraud. The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\").BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties.

The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

It is controlled by China. Smelting is an environmentally harmful\nprocess worse than C02 that can cause environmental damage (water, air).\nTailings from sulphide minerals in mining waste have the potential to\ncreate acid. China Controls 68-80% of nickel refining smelting, and\ncontrols 84% of the Indonesia Nickel Market. A report from the Brookings\nInstitute said that: Even if the U.S. and EU were to dig more minerals out\nof the ground, many of these minerals would need to be shipped overseas for\nconcentrating, refining, and smelting without significant increases in U.S.\nand European mineral refining and smelting capacity. The U.S., in\nparticular, will likely have to update and amend its mining regulatory\nregime. Governments will also have to onshore or friend-shore smelting and\nrefining capacity. The midstream part of the equation is likely to be the\nmost challenging, complicated by high investment costs and market\nconditions. Active Companies mentioned in the article include: First\nAtlantic Nickel Corp. (OTCQB: FANCF) (TSX-V: FAN), Alaska Energy Metals\nCorporation (TSX-V: AEMC) (OTCQB: AKEMF), Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F),\nGeneral Motors Co. (NYSE: GM), TMC the metals company Inc. (NASDAQ: TMC).\n\n     The U.S. Government (USGS) sees a better way saying: The development\nof awaruite deposits in other parts of Canada may help alleviate any\nprolonged shortage of nickel concentrate. Awaruite, a natural iron-nickel\nalloy, is much easier to concentrate than pentlandite, the principal\nsulfide of nickel. Awaruite is safer and more economical to process due to\nthe magnetic separation and concentration. It uses less chemicals, less\nenergy, can be processed directly in North America and since no smelting is\nrequired doesnt need to go to China. Awaruite means no burning, which\nreleases sulfur dioxide and other toxic emissions, and less risk of acid\nmine tailings accidents or contaminations (no sulphide minerals present).\n\n     A report from Science Direct said: Nickel is an important component of\nstainless steel and a wide range of applications which are critical for the\ntransition to clean energies including electric vehicle batteries. Awaruite\nis a native nickeliron alloy that has gained interest as a possible new\neconomic source of nickel. In the last decades, there have been discoveries\nof awaruite, mostly with more significant amounts of nickel sulphides, that\nhave demonstrated the potential for awaruite to contribute to the economics\nof a deposit. This study is focused on the very large Baptiste deposit in\ncentral British Columbia, Canada where awaruite is the primary nickel\nmineral. It concluded: Awaruite has the potential to be concentrated in a\nunique and valuable nickel concentrate of distinctive characteristics\nincluding its very high nickel content, which lowers both the downstream\ncosts and the carbon intensity. Furthermore, the negligible content of\nsulphur and penalty trace elements, such as mercury, antimony, and arsenic\nin a potential awaruite concentrate, minimizes the costs of refining it.\n\n     First Atlantic Nickel Corp.

         "PALM BEACH, Fla., July  29, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FinancialNewsMedia.com News Commentary - The refining of sulfide nickel deposits usually requires a smelting capacity not present today in North America. It is controlled by China. Smelting is an environmentally harmful process worse than C02 that can cause environmental damage (water, air). Tailings from sulphide minerals in mining waste have the potential to create acid. China Controls 68-80% of nickel refining smelting, and controls 84% of the Indonesia Nickel Market. A report from the Brookings Institute said that: “Even if the U.S. and EU were to dig more minerals out of the ground, many of these minerals would need to be shipped overseas for concentrating, refining, and smelting without significant increases in U.S. and European mineral refining and smelting capacity. The U.S., in particular, will likely have to update and amend its mining regulatory regime. Governments will also have to onshore or “friend-shore” smelting and refining capacity. The midstream part of the equation is likely to be the most challenging, complicated by high investment costs and market conditions.” Active Companies mentioned in the article include: First Atlantic Nickel Corp.

(NASDAQ: TMC).The U.S. Government (USGS) sees a better way saying: “The development of awaruite deposits in other parts of Canada may help alleviate any prolonged shortage of nickel concentrate. Awaruite, a natural iron-nickel alloy, is much easier to concentrate than pentlandite, the principal sulfide of nickel. Awaruite is safer and more economical to process due to the magnetic separation and concentration.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

As a result, it is alleged that the company overstated the health of its pipeline and revenue growth prospects.Investors allegedly began to learn the truth on December 7, 2023, when Teradata revealed that certain large deals could be delayed. On this news, the price of Teradata stock declined by $2.89 per share, or 6%, to close at $43.40 per share on December 7, 2023.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

A copy of the lawsuit can be found here: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/CAEComplaint.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning significant cost overruns in CAE's Defense and Security (\"Defense\") segment caused by several fixed-price, long-term Defense contracts entered prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and \"re-baselin[e]\" its entire Defense business.On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts. On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $4.32 per share, or more than 16%, from $25.80 per share on August 9, 2022, to $21.48 per share on August 10, 2022.Defendants, however, continued to make false representations regarding the strength of the Defense segment.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

(Nasdaq:MDB) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your MongoDB investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.Investors have until September 9, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Norbert Gamache v. CAE Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05360. A copy of the lawsuit can be found here: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/CAEComplaint.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning significant cost overruns in CAE's Defense and Security (\"Defense\") segment caused by several fixed-price, long-term Defense contracts entered prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and \"re-baselin[e]\" its entire Defense business.On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts.

The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

         "NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 22, 2024 / Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP (\"BFA\") announces that it has filed a class action lawsuit for violations of the federal securities laws against CAE Inc. (\"CAE\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:CAE) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered a loss on your CAE investment, please submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases/cae-inc-investigation.The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in CAE who purchased or acquired CAE stock on an exchange in the United States between February 11, 2022 and May 21, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Norbert Gamache v. CAE Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05360. A copy of the lawsuit can be found here: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/CAEComplaint.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning significant cost overruns in CAE's Defense and Security (\"Defense\") segment caused by several fixed-price, long-term Defense contracts entered prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In truth, certain of CAE's pre-COVID fixed-price Defense contracts had experienced such significant cost overruns that the Company needed to take over $720 million in charges and profit adjustments and \"re-baselin[e]\" its entire Defense business.On August 10, 2022, the Company announced $28.9 million in unfavorable contract profit adjustments involving two fixed-price contracts. On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $4.32 per share, or more than 16%, from $25.80 per share on August 9, 2022, to $21.48 per share on August 10, 2022.Defendants, however, continued to make false representations regarding the strength of the Defense segment. For instance, the Company assured investors that \"[n]otwithstanding the additional volatility\" from \"acute short-term headwinds for the Defense sector, management maintains a highly positive view of its growth potential over a multi-year period.\"On November 14, 2023, CAE stated that certain legacy contracts continued to be plagued by cost overruns. CAE revealed that, within the Defense segment, the Company planned to \"retir[e] legacy contracts, which have been most affected by inflationary pressures.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $0.85 per share, or nearly 4%, from $21.92 per share on November 13, 2023, to $21.07 per share on November 14, 2023.Three months later, on February 14, 2024, CAE announced that it \"sought to further accelerate the retirement of outstanding program risks, mainly associated with certain legacy Defense contracts that we entered into pre-COVID and have been most impacted by economic headwinds.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $2.01 per share, or nearly 10%, from $20.92 per share on February 13, 2024, to $18.91 per share on February 14, 2024.Finally, after the close of trading on May 21, 2024, CAE announced a \"re-baselining of its Defense business, Defense impairments, [and] accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts.\" The Company stated that \"CAE has recorded a $568.0 million non-cash impairment of Defense goodwill,\" \"$90.3 million in unfavorable Defense contract profit adjustments as a result of accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts,\" and a \"$35.7 million impairment of related technology and other non-financial assets which are principally related to the Legacy Contracts.\" On this news, the price of CAE stock declined $1.03 per share, or more than 5%, from $19.83 per share on May 21, 2024, to $18.80 per share on May 22, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/cae-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in CAE, Inc. you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

(NYSE:GL) and its directors and certain senior executives for breaches of their fiduciary duties by failing to stop, and/or condoning, pervasive fraud and sexual harassment at the Company.If you are a long-term holder of Globe Life, you are encouraged to submit your information at: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.Investigation Details:A recent investor report has exposed troubling allegations that Globe Life is engaged in widespread insurance fraud. The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\").BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties. BFA intends to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of Globe Life stockholders and to ensure that the fiduciaries are held accountable for the Company's pervasive violations of the law.Click here if you are a long-term holder:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.What Can You Do?If you are a current holder of Globe Life Inc. stock, you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

(Nasdaq:MDB) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your MongoDB investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.Investors have until September 9, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in MongoDB securities between August 31, 2023 and May 30, 2024, inclusive. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

         "NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 21, 2024 / Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP announces it has filed a lawsuit against UiPath, Inc. (\"UiPath\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:PATH) and certain of the Company's senior executives.If you suffered losses on your UiPath investment, you are encouraged to submit your information athttps://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.Investors have until August 19, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in UiPath securities between December 1, 2023 and the close of trading on May 29, 2024 inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Zack Steiner v. UiPath, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-4702. A copy of the lawsuit can be found: https://www.bfalaw.com/siteFiles/Cases/show_temp.pdf.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the success of UiPath's turnaround strategy. For instance, defendants represented that the Company was \"executing against that strategy, and we're seeing [the] results in the deal quality and the customer quality,\" asserted that \"our strategic investments in innovations and our go-to-market ecosystem positions us well for continued momentum,\" and that \"there's no doubt there's [been] better execution\" since the implementation of the turnaround strategy.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, UiPath's turnaround strategy had failed. Fruitless investments and inconsistent execution plagued the Company's overhauled go-to-market strategy. Additionally, UiPath's AI-powered Business Automation Platform caused \"confusion\" among customers and was not able to be adequately scaled. As a result, UiPath experienced significant difficulties closing and/or expanding large multiyear deals.On May 29, 2024, UiPath announced the sudden departure of CEO Robert Enslin. On the same day, UiPath announced disappointing 1Q 25 financial results and significantly cut its FY 25 revenue guidance by 10%, or $150 million. The Company attributed the poor results and guidance to several factors related to its failed turnaround strategy, including an inadequate \"execution strategy to scale\" the Company's AI-powered growth products \"to reach their full potential,\" and that AI had \"create[ed] a little bit of confusion with our customers.\" Ui Path also described how the \"investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, [and] made us less agile in responding to customer needs\" while experiencing \"contract execution challenges on large deals.\"This news caused the price of UiPath stock to decline $6.23 per share, or more than 34%, from $18.30 per share on May 29, 2024, to $12.07 per share on May 30, 2024, resulting in significant harm to investors.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases/uipath-inc-investigation.What Can You Do?If you invested in UiPath, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

(NYSE:GL) and its directors and certain senior executives for breaches of their fiduciary duties by failing to stop, and/or condoning, pervasive fraud and sexual harassment at the Company.If you are a long-term holder of Globe Life, you are encouraged to submit your information at: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.Investigation Details:A recent investor report has exposed troubling allegations that Globe Life is engaged in widespread insurance fraud. The investor report relies on whistleblower complaints, interviews with former employees, public lawsuits, and other credible sources. Based on that information, the report concludes that instances of insurance fraud have been unearthed at the Company's sales agencies that account for $200 million of the annualized life premiums paid by customers, or roughly 60% of all premiums. The rampant instances of insurance fraud seem to stem from a perverse bonus structure that compensates agents for the life of an insurance policy within a short amount of time (usually within 6 months), even if the policy itself is cancelled shortly after that time. As a result, sales agents have an incentive to commit fraud, sometimes paying the premiums themselves with bonus money, with little oversight from the Company.As a result of these wrongful actions, Globe Life is currently party to numerous lawsuits and investigations, including an investigation by the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\").BFA is concerned that the board of directors and certain senior management of Globe Life may have breached their fiduciary duties. BFA intends to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of Globe Life stockholders and to ensure that the fiduciaries are held accountable for the Company's pervasive violations of the law.Click here if you are a long-term holder:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/globe-life-inc.What Can You Do?If you are a current holder of Globe Life Inc. stock, you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.

The complaint alleges that between February 13, 2023 and February 12, 2024, Teradata and certain of its senior executives made materially false and misleading statements related to: (a) the success of the company's recently expanded business model to market products to customers beyond their IT units; (b) the robustness of the company's pipeline and ability to timely close deals; and (c) the company's revenue growth prospects.The complaint further alleges that, in reality, Teradata's expanded business model caused significant delays in the closing of large customer transactions. As a result, it is alleged that the company overstated the health of its pipeline and revenue growth prospects.Investors allegedly began to learn the truth on December 7, 2023, when Teradata revealed that certain large deals could be delayed. On this news, the price of Teradata stock declined by $2.89 per share, or 6%, to close at $43.40 per share on December 7, 2023. Then, on February 12, 2024, Teradata announced that \"deal timing issues\" caused the company to miss its previously issued ARR guidance.

The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned John Baxter v. MongoDB, Inc., et al., No. 1:24-cv-05191.What is the Lawsuit About?The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented the purported benefits stemming from the restructuring of its sales force. This includes how the restructuring helped reduce friction in acquiring new customers and increased new workload acquisition among existing customers.These statements were allegedly materially false and misleading. In truth, MongoDB's sales force restructuring resulted in a near total loss of upfront customer commitments, a significant reduction in actionable information gathered by the sales force, and hindered enrollment and revenue growth.On March 7, 2024, the Company allegedly announced that due to the sales restructuring, it experienced an annual decrease of approximately $40 million in multiyear license revenue, anticipated near zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments (one of its core offerings) in fiscal year 2025, and provided a disappointing revenue growth forecast that trailed that of the prior year. This news caused the price of MongoDB stock to decline $28.59 per share, or about 7%, from $412.01 per share on March 7, 2024, to $383.42 per share on March 8, 2024.Then, on May 30, 2024, the Company again announced significantly reduced growth expectations, this time cutting fiscal year 2025 growth projections further, again attributing the losses to the sales force restructuring. On this news, the price of MongoDB stock declined $73.94 per share, or nearly 24%, from $310.00 per share on May 30, 2024, to $236.06 per share on May 31, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses:https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/mongodb-inc.What Can You Do?If you invested in MongoDB, Inc. you have rights and are encouraged to submit your information to speak with an attorney.All representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

natural ironnickel\nalloy is much easier to concentrate than pentlandite the principal\nsulfide of nickel awaruite is safer and more economical to process due to\nthe magnetic separation and concentration it uses less chemicals less\nenergy can be processed directly in north america and since no smelting is\nrequired doesnt need to go to china awaruite means no burning which\nreleases sulfur dioxide and other toxic emissions and less risk of acid\nmine tailings accidents or contaminations no sulphide minerals present\n\n     a report from science direct said nickel is an important

metals company inc nasdaq tmc an explorer of the world’s largest estimated undeveloped source of critical battery metals recently announced that it has successfully produced the world’s first cobalt sulfate derived exclusively from seafloor polymetallic nodules the cobalt sulfate was generated during benchscale testing of tmc’s hydrometallurgical flowsheet design with sgs canada inc “sgs” the test work was carried out at sgs’ metallurgical centre of excellence testing facility in lakefield ontariobased on samples of nickelcobaltcopper matte first produced by tmc in 2021 the extractive metallurgy team at sgs tested tmc’s efficient flowsheet to process highgrade nickelcoppercobalt matte directly to highpurity cobalt sulfate without making cobalt metal while producing fertilizer byproducts instead of solid waste or tailings this milestone follows last month’s successful production of nickel sulfate a key raw material input used in the production of energydense electric

canada may help\n alleviate projected shortages of nickel concentrate\n\n     financialnewsmediacom news commentary  the refining of sulfide\nnickel deposits usually requires a smelting capacity not present in north\namerica it is controlled by china smelting is an environmentally harmful\nprocess worse than c02 that can cause environmental damage water air\ntailings from sulphide minerals in mining waste have the potential to\ncreate acid china controls 6880 of nickel refining smelting and\ncontrols 84 of the indonesia nickel market a report from the brookings\ninstitute said that even if the us and eu were to dig more minerals out\nof the ground many of these minerals would need to be shipped overseas for\nconcentrating refining and smelting without significant increases in us\nand european mineral refining and smelting capacity the us in\nparticular will likely have to update and amend its mining regulatory\nregime governments will also have to onshore or friendshore smelting and\nrefining capacity the midstream part of the equation is likely to be the\nmost challenging complicated by high investment costs and market\nconditions active companies mentioned in the article include first\natlantic nickel corp otcqb fancf tsxv fan alaska energy metals\ncorporation tsxv aemc otcqb akemf ford motor company nyse f\ngeneral motors co nyse gm tmc the metals company inc nasdaq tmc\n\n     the us government usgs sees a better way saying the development\nof awaruite deposits in other parts of canada may help alleviate any\nprolonged shortage of nickel concentrate awaruite a natural ironnickel\nalloy is much easier to concentrate than pentlandite the principal\nsulfide of nickel awaruite is safer and more economical to process due to\nthe magnetic separation and concentration it uses less chemicals less\nenergy can be processed directly in north america and since no smelting is\nrequired doesnt need to go to china awaruite means no burning which\nreleases sulfur dioxide and other toxic emissions and less risk of acid\nmine tailings accidents or contaminations no sulphide minerals present\n\n     a report from science direct said nickel is an important component of\nstainless steel and a wide range of applications which are critical for the\ntransition to clean energies including electric vehicle batteries awaruite\nis a native nickeliron alloy that has gained interest as a possible new\neconomic source of nickel in the last decades there have been discoveries\nof awaruite mostly with more significant amounts of nickel sulphides that\nhave demonstrated the potential for awaruite to contribute to the economics\nof a deposit this study is focused on the very large baptiste deposit in\ncentral british columbia canada where awaruite is the primary nickel\nmineral it concluded awaruite has the potential to be concentrated in a\nunique and valuable nickel concentrate of distinctive characteristics\nincluding its very high nickel content which lowers both the downstream\ncosts and the carbon intensity furthermore the negligible content of\nsulphur and penalty trace elements such as mercury antimony and arsenic\nin a potential awaruite concentrate minimizes the costs of refining it\n\n     first atlantic nickel corp otcqb fancf tsxv fan hosts\nstrategic investor site visit expands geological team and reports\nmilestones on

the establishment of operations directly\non the project site enhancing future operational efficiency\n\n     the installation of the first bridge marks a significant milestone in\nconducting largescale districtsize mining exploration operations the\nroad will provide faster and closer access to additional awaruite zones\nthroughout the district allowing for yearround exploration work and\ndrilling improved road access reduces the cost per meter of drilling\nenabling significantly more drilling activities\n\n     exploration updates preparations are underway for the exploration\ncamp with a permit in place the camp will serve as a strategic base for\nonsite operations enabling the exploration team to work efficiently in\nthe field to ensure yearround access to the site road upgrades are being\nimplemented allowing for easy ground access regardless of the season\n\n     the exploration program is focusing on grading and prioritizing\nawaruite outcrops as

         "palm beach fla july  29 2024  globe newswire  financialnewsmediacom news commentary  the refining of sulfide nickel deposits usually requires a smelting capacity not present today in north america it is controlled by china smelting is an environmentally harmful process worse than c02 that can cause environmental damage water air tailings from sulphide minerals in mining waste have the potential to create acid china controls 6880 of nickel refining smelting and controls 84 of the indonesia nickel market a report from the brookings institute said that “even if the us and eu were to dig more minerals out of the ground many of these minerals would need to be shipped overseas for concentrating refining and smelting without significant increases in us and european mineral refining and smelting capacity the us in particular will likely have to update and amend its mining regulatory regime governments will also have to onshore or “friendshore” smelting and refining capacity the midstream part of the equation is likely to be the most challenging complicated by high investment costs and market conditions” active companies mentioned in the article include first atlantic nickel corp otcqb fancf tsxv fan alaska energy metals corporation tsxv aemc otcqb akemf ford motor company nyse f general motors co nyse gm tmc the metals company inc nasdaq tmcthe us government usgs sees a better way saying “the development of awaruite deposits in other parts of canada may help alleviate any prolonged shortage of nickel concentrate awaruite a natural ironnickel alloy is much easier to concentrate than pentlandite the principal sulfide of nickel awaruite is safer and more economical to process due to the magnetic separation and concentration it uses less chemicals less energy can be processed directly in north america and since no smelting is required doesn’t need to go to china awaruite means no burning which releases sulfur dioxide and other toxic emissions and less risk of acid mine tailings accidents or contaminations no sulphide minerals present”a report from science direct said “nickel is an important component of stainless steel and a wide range of applications which are critical for the transition to clean energies including electric vehicle batteries awaruite is a native nickel–iron alloy that has gained interest as a possible new economic source of nickel in the last decades there have been discoveries of awaruite mostly with more significant amounts of nickel sulphides that have demonstrated the potential for awaruite to contribute to the economics of a deposit this study is focused on the very large baptiste deposit in central british columbia canada where awaruite is the primary nickel mineral” it concluded “awaruite has the potential to be concentrated in a unique and valuable nickel concentrate of distinctive characteristics including its very high nickel content which lowers both the downstream costs and the carbon intensity furthermore the negligible content of sulphur and penalty trace elements such as mercury antimony and arsenic in a potential awaruite concentrate minimizes the costs of refining it”first atlantic nickel corp otcqb fancf tsxv fan hosts strategic investor site visit expands geological team and reports milestones on infrastructure upgrades at atlantic nickel project

metals company inc nasdaq tmc an explorer of the world’s largest estimated undeveloped source of critical battery metals recently announced that it has successfully produced the world’s first cobalt sulfate derived exclusively from seafloor polymetallic nodules the cobalt sulfate was generated during benchscale testing of tmc’s hydrometallurgical flowsheet design with sgs canada inc “sgs” the test work was carried out at sgs’ metallurgical centre of excellence testing facility in lakefield ontariobased on samples of nickelcobaltcopper matte first produced by tmc in 2021 the extractive metallurgy team at sgs tested tmc’s efficient flowsheet to process highgrade nickelcoppercobalt matte directly to highpurity cobalt sulfate without making cobalt metal while producing fertilizer byproducts instead of solid waste or tailings this milestone follows last month’s successful production of nickel sulfate a key raw material input used in the production of energydense electric
